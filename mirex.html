<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B> This page is no longer live, since MIR occupation ended on 27 August 1999.  It is retained here for historical purposes and in hopes of a reactivation in January 2000.</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This page monitors MIR's 145.985 MHz packet downlink as seen here at The Naval Academy in Maryland (USA) and captures all packets in <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/mirpass.htm">Mir Pass Files</A> and holds them for about one day.  <A HREF="http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/temp/mir_loc.html"> Where is MIR now?</A>

<P><B>MIR/APRS Handheld Satellite Comm Test:</B>  In early June an impromptu comm test was conducted via MIR to test the viability of using 5 watt handhelds
with their own whip antennas to communicate via a conventional UI Digipeater in space.  The test was an unqualified success! <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/mir-ht.txt">See the report.</A>

<P> <B> MIR/APRS School Club Roundup 8-13 FEB 1999: </B>  The annual <A HREF="http://www.arrl.org/contests/announcements/99/scr.html">ARRL School Club Roundup </A>event encourages schools everywhere to get on the air.  This year, in conjunction with the ongoing APRS/MIR school test, schools can also enjoy learning about satellite communications.  All you need is a 2m radio, a TNC and a PC.  Here are the results so far!  Notice that this is only what we see here
in Maryland on the East Coast.  Western stations will see a totally different
downlink.

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/javaprs/mirSCR-M.txt"> MONDAY'S RESULTS! </A> </B> We captured four good passes and we are seeing many participants!

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/javaprs/mirSCR-T.txt"> TUESDAY'S RESULTS! </A> </B> More UI stations showing up, but two passes were mixed with some VOICE and some SSTV.  
Notice N0ZHY-7 using only the Kenwood HT!

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/javaprs/mirSCR-W.txt"> WEDNESDAY'S RESULTS! </A> </B> Packet is back on... Looking real good!  Here is the best SSTV image we got on Tuesday.

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/javaprs/mirSCR-U.txt"> THURSDAY'S RESULTS! </A> </B> In the second and third pass today, notice W8XF-7 and VA3PRG-9 using only the Kenwood HT!  It is a compressed position report, but plots just fine on the APRS map.

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/javaprs/mirSCR-F.txt"> FRIDAY'S RESULTS! </A> </B> Lots of activity today!

<P>An initial <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/mirtest.txt"> APRS/MIR test</A> was held on 11 Mar 98. Its objective was to show the application of APRS one-to-all protocols for improving the visibility of MIR experiments to students and schools. </P>

<P><B>OUR STATION:</B> Our MIREX station consists of nothing but a 19" whip antenna feeding a common <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/mir-stn.jpg"> 2mFM receiver and TNC.</A>  The output of the TNC is plugged into one of the office 9600 baud terminal servers which has been TELNETted to www.mirex.net port 10001.
</P>

<P><B>FUTURE:</B>  We are looking for other MIREX groundstations to TELNET their TNC output live to us.  Stations in Madrid, Mexico, Taiwan and Chicago are under contruction.  When complete, you will be able to see LIVE TNC packets from MIR over most part


s of the world by TELNETting to <A HREF="http://www.mirex.net">www.mirex.net port 10001</A>. To see a much more active channel, TELNET to the live APRS feed at  <A HREF="http://www.aprs.net">www.aprs.net port 23</A>. ALthough These are shown here as HTML links, you will not see the raw packets unless you TELNET to them.</P>

12 Dec 98 First MIR SSTV images! </B> MIR is now transmitting live SSTV
images on many passes.  I captured the first days worth and posted the
1st one here (below) and the remainder on our local <A HREF="aprn.html">
<B> APRN</B> </A> Page.  Initial tests are on 145.985 on weekends but SSTV will eventually move to UHF.
