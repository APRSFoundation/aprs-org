<B>PCSAT2 HAS RETURNED TO EARTH:</B> After a final month of special amateur radio communications 
experiments with the FM Voice repeater, 
PCSAT2 was recovered from the outside of the ISS by 
astronauts on the 3rd EVA of mission STS-115 and it has now been returned safely to Earth.
  This is the first Amateur 
Radio Satellite that has ever returned intact and operational.  
We look forward to opening it up and seeing what a year in space has done to it.
We hope to follow up with future missions (<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/pcsat3.html"><B>PCSAT3</B></A>).

<B>PCSAT2 BEGAN OPS on 3 Aug 2005:</B>  PCSAT2 (looks like an astronaut suitcase) was installed by 
astronaut Soichi Noguchi 
on the outside of the ISS on 3 Aug during EVA3.  The left photo is the suitcase in
his left hand with the Solar Cell side which should face the sun.  The right photo 
is the backside with PCSAT2 electronics under the 
gold colored thermal blanket.  The ISS P6 truss and ISS solar array axis 
are in the background.  There are some tape samples on its outside to see 
how they weather in space.  

See our <A HREF="pec/PC2day1.txt"><B>summary of day 1 activities</B></A>.

<P>



 PCSAT2 completed a 4 week test of its PSK31 Amateur Radid HF/UHF Transponder mode and is now
operating in APRS Packet Digipeater mode.  Its telemetry and downlink user data is being collected by special ham radio volunteer 
ground stations around the world. You can see the 
<A HREF="http://www.pcsat2.info/PCSat2Web/index.do"><B> live telemetry on the web</B></A>.
  Announcements will be made on the AMSAT-BB Email reflector.

<B>PCSAT2 OPERATIONS:</B> The <A HREF="pec/pc2ops.html"><B>PCSAT2 Operations web page</B></A> 
is used for informing ground stations and volunteers.  Currently our main objective is 
support user packet radio 
communications experiments with a 145.825 uplink and 435.275 +/- 10 KHz 
Doppler downlink.  Experiments were conducted for the first 4 weeks with the
 PSK-31 transponder showing excellent signals at the beginning with only a 4Watt 
29 MHz uplink signal.  But after a few weeks the receiver has faded and
 it takes 100W or more to be heard. (Later discovered to be a broken antenna during the EVA installation of the suitcase).  This mode is now considered not operational.
See the <A HREF="pec/PC2PSK0805.JPG"><B>image</B></A> of the first PSK signals 
we heard through the PSK-31 transponder.

<A HREF="http://setas-www.larc.nasa.gov/meep/meep.html"><B>MIR as MEEP</B></A>.  
It is attached to the exterior of the ISS during an EVA to expose 
its samples to space as shown below.  MISSE5 was assembled at the Navy Research Labs, 
with samples of high-tech DOD solar cells on the side
 of MISSE that faces the sun. It has no Radio system and accumulates its data in EEPROM for review on return to earth.  On the back side, the Naval Academy was able to conjur a ride for its 
Amateur Satellite  Communications system similar to what it is flying on 
<A HREF="pcsat.html"><B> PCsat </B></A>.  It supports 
educational and student outreach objectives of both AMSAT and ARRL as well as provide 
telemetry on the health of the system.

The <B>PCSAT2</B>comm system operates in the ITU 
Amateur Satellite Service in 
<A HREF="pec/ARISSmins.txt"> cooperation with ARISS </A>
 and can provide a PSK-31 multi-user transponder, an FM voice
repeater for possible use with ISS Crew communications and an AX.25 packet system
for possible use as a UI digipeater and for telemetry, command, control as shown in the
<A HREF="pec/PC2-Comms.gif"><B>block diagram</B></A>.  
The PEC is basically a suitcase for travel that opens in space as shown above.  
The solar panel side of the PEC contains new technology solar 
cells which will be captured into EEPROM on the techincal 
investigation of the radiation effects on these cells.  THe EEPROM science data will be reviewd after a year in space when the PEC hardware is returned to Earth. See the

<B>SPONSORING ORGANIZATION:</B> The PCSAT2 project is a student engineering project under the 
USNA Aerospace Engineering program with the guidance of LTCL Billy Smith 
and Satellite Lab Senior Research Engineer, Bob Bruninga, WB4APR.  The USNA Amateur 
Radio Club and other volunteer control operators are the spacecraft operating organization.  Since PCSAT2 is flying 
on the ISS, its operations will be fully coordinated with the ARISS (Amateur Radio on the ISS)
international team.  

<P>


<B> PCSAT2 DESCRIPTION: </B> PCSAT2 uses the same dual redundant AX.25 
command and control system as used on the
<A HREF="pcsat.html"><B> original PCsat </B></A> (NO44) offering 8 on/off commands, 20 
telemetry channels.  It also
 supports the
<A HREF="pec/pecpln.txt">Digital Comms Relay support</A> of the PCsat/APRS mission. 

The uplinks are on 2 meters and the downlinks are in the 435 MHz band to avoid any 
possible interference with existing ARISS 2 meter operations.  Observers will note that 
this is exactly opposite of the long range plan for all ARISS downlinks on 2 meters 
and uplinks on other bands, but it had to be this way, beacuse at the time of the 
PCSAT2 design freeze in Dec 2002, there was no equipment on ISS capable of cross band 
operation.  The Kenwood D700 was not to arrive for several months later.  Unfortunately 
the 2 year Shuttle delays allowed the D700 to arrive on ISS before PCSAT2 but long 
after the PCSAT2 design freeze which required it to operate down on UHF.
<P>


PCSAT2 has quad redundant transmit inhibits for EVA safety issues  Also, the 
mission lifetime of PCSAT2 is only 1 year, because its host is a sample-return mission, thus 
terminating any long term conflicts in spectrum management.  After PCSAT2 is removed 
from ISS, then hopefully all future ISS Amateur Radio missions will use 2m downlinks 
and other bands for uplinks to avoid any operational interference between modes.


<P>

<P>


<B>BAND PLANNING:</B> One of the key issues with any Amateur Radio experiments on ISS is 
the requirement to avoid any mutual interference between systems.  For this reason, 
future systems will probably move all uplinks and downlinks on ISS into separate bands. 
This is so that multiple uplinks and multiple downlinks can be going on simultaneously. 
At the time of the PCSAT2 design freeze (Dec 02),  ISS operated with both uplinks and 
downlinks on 2m, thus, 2m was only available as an uplink to PCSAT2.  Thus PCSAT2 had 
to be designed with a UHF downlink to avoid transmitting on 2m, even though 
downlinks on 2m is much preferred for reaching schools and simple stations and 
meeting our mission objectives.  Until the 1 year PCSAT2 mission is over, we are stuck with this UHF downlink mode.  Ultimately, we believe all ISS downlinks 
should be on 2 meters and have been working from our 
<A HREF="iss-aprs/bandplan.txt"><B> original paper</B></A> to that regard.  
In the mean time, here is a possible 
<A HREF="iss-aprs/bandplan.jpg"><B> old band plan idea</B></A>.  These links
 are opinions only, and have no credibility with ARISS.

<P>


<B> COMMUNICATIONS MISSION DETAILS:</B>

<P>


The PCSAT2 mission was an opportunity to augment existing Amateur Radio ARISS
 communications experiments with an external autonomous communications payload. 
In this regard, it had three potential uses:

<LI> A <A HREF="astars.html"><B>UI-Digipeater</B></A> to help ease congestion on the currently shared ARISS PMS (Packet Mail system) 

<LI> A <A HREF="psk31uplink.html"><B> PSK-31 transponder </B></A>
 for multi-user comms to improve accessibility for schools 
and ARISS outreach programs 

<LI> An <A HREF="iss-aprs/ARISS-fdux.jpg"><B> FM Voice repeater </B></A> for full duplex
 special ARISS or crew communications to facilitate school outreach. 

<LI> Routine <A HREF="pec/PC2eqns.txt"><B>Telemetry </B></A> on the amateur radio spacecraft systems.

<P>


<B>USER RECOMMENDATIONS:</B> As was the case for PCsat, and in accordance with 
the rules for operation in the Amateur Satellite Service, all duly licensed 
operators worldwide are welcome to use the PCSAT2 transponders in accordance 
with the published guidelines.  To keep users fully informed of their expected 
uplink requirements, we have published and maintain an active and current
<A HREF="pec/useragreemt.txt"> User Service Agreement</A> for guidance to all users.

<P>


This kind of open publishing of the detailed user expectations pioneered by PCsat was 
entirely successful and we were very pleased that Amateur Satellite operators worldwide 
in general adherred well to the recommendations for the benefit of all.
