<B>APRN</B> is a concept that should revolutionize the use of amateur radio
in support of emergencies, special events and public service.  It allows
mobile, portable and handheld operators to send back live images from
the field for real-time review by anyone, anywhere, using ANY radio!  Prior to APRN, images could
be sent from one SSTV station to another, but since fewer than a 
fraction of 1% of ham operators had SSTV capability, there was no way
to get the image from the receiver to the person, VIP, or agency that
needed it.
<P>
    All of that changed in the early 2000's with the advent of SIX powerful Ham Radio 
technologies that had coalessed in the last few years:<P>
<UL>
<IMG SRC="APRN/THD7pixX.jpg" align=right>
<IMG SRC="APRN/VCH1.jpg" align=right>

<LI> Kenwood introduced the hand-held SSTV Ken-Cam (VC-H1) that can send/receive SSTV images in 1997
<LI> Kenwood introduced the hand-held APRS Radio (TH-D7) that can send/receive text messaging in 1998
<LI> The <A HREF="aprs.html">APRS Network </A> has grown to provide worldwide connectivity
<LI> The Internet can distribute the SSTV images anywhere worldwide, just like APRS can distribute the titles
<LI> The APRN network concept provides users with 
      a consistent and reliable interface
<LI> The first <B> APRN
<A HREF="http://www.qsl.net/kb2scs/aprn.html">software was been written by KB2SCS!</B></A>
<LI> <B>NEW IN THIS DECADE:</B>  ANY PC, laptop, tablet or smart phone can send/receive SSTV images directly from any radio
</UL>

<P>
<B>The APRN Concept:</B>  The APRN Concept is simple.  One takes an image using any smartphone or other SSTV camera, then enters the title and any comments into a MESSAGE to APRN on their APRS radio.  Then they go to the local APRN frequency in their area and send the packet.  When it is acknowledged by APRS message, then they activate their SSTV ap and send the image audio over the same radio.  The APRN receiver then places the image on the local APRN Web page and it is available for anyone to see on the APRN web page.  It also sends out a NEW IMAGE announcement on the local APRS channel so all APRS users in the area can see it.

<P>
<B>AND/OR,</B> any other ham with an SSTV application can go to that same local frequency and with an APRS message, request any image that is on file.  Thus, we have real-time critical image exchange over ham radio independent of the cell phone network - usable in emergencies or when networks are down.


<P>
<B>KEN-CAM (Kenwood VC-H1): </B>Although SSTV has been around for 50 years or more, 
it had always been a relatively boring exchange of pre-captured images between hamshacks.  
In the late 1990's, Camera interfaces existed, but it still 
required a PC or other large appliance to convert the image to SSTV.
The arrival of the Kenwood KEN-CAM (VC-H1) in 1997 (shown at right), completely changed
the playing field, since the entire image system fit in a shirt pocket or
the palm of your hand and could be used anywhere when plugged into the companion APRS hand held also shown here.  This was a full decade before cell phones started adding cameras.  This, combined with
the public's general acceptance of still-frame video over the
internet totally embraced a complete paradigm shift to a totally new
real-time in-the-field imaging capability.
<P>

<B>SMART Phones and Tablets are NOW:</B>  Unlike in 1990's when only a fraction of 1% of hams had a VCH1 handheld SSTV device, now in the decade since 2010, almost everone now has a smart phone or tablet with built in disply and camera that can with the right application, send and receive images from anywhere at any time via the wireless system.  But the importance of the APRN network is that it takes this one step further when the cellphone is out of network.  Then the same phone can be held next to a Ham Radio HT and just by audio coupling, can send and receive the image via the SSTV application.
<P>
<B>Here are some smart phone SSTV Aps that anyone can use:</B>

<P>
<B>SSTV Transmissions from the ISS:</B> For the past several years, an SSTV transmitter has been on the ISS and is activated occasionally for special events.  These SSTV applications can all receive these images with norhing more than an FM radio or walkie-talkie.  
See <A HREF="https://spacecomms.wordpress.com/iss-sstv-reception-hints/"><B>SSTV from ISS</B></A>
 And also KO6KL's<A HREF="http://www.valleymedia.org/sstv/"><B> live HF SSTV web page</B></A>
<P>

<B>APRS HT (Kenwood TH-D7) </B>The key to the automation of the WEB PAGE 
interface for APRN is the availability of text messaging in any of the APRS 
walkie-talkies. . These radios, without a computer, or any external components, 
allows a user to send a packet identifier for the subsequent transmitted SSTV audio image.
This packet message contains a machine readable single packet identifier that
includes the CALLSIGN, LOCATION, TIME, TITLE, Direction and field of view of the image!
<P>
<B>APRS IMAGE IDENTIFICATION: </B> The keypad on the APRS HT can be used for 
entering the necessary alphanumerics and the built-in TNC then transmits it.  
Since the APRS radio also knows its position, then the LAT/LONG of the SSTV image
is also automatically included!  Thus you can transmit the WHO, WHAT
WHEN, and WHERE needed for full automation of the WEB page for 
cataloging and indexing real-time images from multiple remote
users.
<P><B>POSITION REPORTING: </B> The existing worldwide <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/aprs.fi">APRS.FI </A>
network  
serves as the GEO-POSITION locator system for APRN to show WHERE the images 
were taken in real time.

<P>
<B>APRN NETWORK</B>
The APRN network is not really a network at all.  It is only 
a web page that captures uplinked images and applies the APRS transmitted identifying information so that the SSTV images can be indexed and sorted by location, call, time, or event.  These local APRS sites can be set up on any locally designated frequency in cities everywhere
for SSTV images to be uplinked to the nearest APRN
node which then hosts the images as WEB pages.  
These local networks can be as simple or complex as
needed to provide the mobile converage needed.  ANyone can find them, since they identify themselves with a <A HREF="localinfo.html"><B>FREQUENCY OBJECT</B></A> on the local APRS channel.  A few examples
follow:
<UL><LI>
    <B>Local Simplex Uplink -</B>  This is simply a 2 meter radio at the
    WEB server that listens for SSTV uplinks.  Range is limited by
    the height of the antenna at the web site.

<LI><B>Crossband relay -</B> This is probably the most practical arrangement
    since it allows placing a 2m receiver at a high remote receive 
    site and then linking the audio down to the valley Web server.
    Besides vastly increased range due to the high site receiver,
    this system also permits other SSTV operators to monitor the
    SSTV linked images live.
<LI>
    <B>Metropolitan Crossband Relay -</B> This just adds additional remote
    2 meter receive sites that all link back to the WEB site still
    on the same UHF channel, or multiple UHF channels depending
    on popularity of the system.  The web page can operate a scanner
    to capture images on all crosslink channels.
<LI>
    <B>Voice Repeater Relay -</B> This simply takes advantage of existing
    2 meter voice repeater inputs by adding only the crosslink UHF
    transmitter at existing repeater sites.  A mute circuit mutes 
    the output of the repeater while an SSTV link is in progress.
    It is doubtful that there is any technical advantage to this
    arrangement since it will in most cases be politically unacceptible.
</UL>

<P>
<B>FREQUENCIES:</B>  Frequencies are a local issue only.  Typically, only
one frequency is needed and it can be shared with other applications.
ALso, since only mobiles or remotes uplink on the channel in simplex
to the APRN receiver, any simplex frequency can be used.  There is no
need for the APRN site to transmit anything on the channel back to the
user other than a brief 1 second acknowledgment.  Thus it is consistent 
with simplex shared use.
<P>

<B>APRN FORMAT:</B>  The value added to SSTV by the APRS identification packet cannot be
over emphasized.  Without this human readable data, the SSTV image is just an un-identifiable
picture.  But with an APRS packet identifier, then the picture becomes so much more
valuable.  . All of the following information is added to the picture with APRS:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Position (LAT/LONG) to the nearest 60 feet or so
<LI> Originating Callsign
<LI> Subject or title or label for the picture
<LI> DIRECTION that the camera was facing at the time of the image
<LI> Field-of-View in degrees of the image
<LI> Any additional comments by the originator
<LI> WEB Page URL locator for the image.
</UL>
<P>

<B> APRS SSTV SYMBOL:</B> Since 1997, APRS has a well defined SSTV symbol <B>"/T"</B>.
 . Any station sending a packet as an SSTV image identifier packet, should use this
symbol.  All of the above fields are self explanitory except for the DIRECTION and FOV. .
It is proposed that for this symbol and this application, that the normal CSE/SPD field
of the packet be interpreted not as CSE/SPD but as DIR/FOV. . The use of CSE to indicate
the direction the camera is pointing is relatively straight forward.  But we can use the
SPD field to include the width of the FOV in degrees. . There is no loss of significance
to the actual CSE and SPD fields, because if this packet is being used to identify a
picture, then CSE and SPD are meaningless in this context.  But DIR and FOV are very
valuable.  . Imagine an APRS map that can not only show the location that an image was
taken, but also the camera direction and FOV with an overlayed WEDGE!
<P>
<B>GLOBAL APRN ACCESS:</B> All of the above items of information associated with the
image are transmitted in the initial packet by the originator.  This is what any APRS
packet station wouild capture if he were monitoring the original packet. . But the 
real value-added by the local APRN-Receiving node is the archiving of that image and
that data for on-line retrieval by anyone, anywhere via the internet.  In that regard,
the APRN takes the originators original APRS packet, parses out the information and 
after archiving the data, it then re-formats the data into a new standard APRN
packet onto the APRS-IS but with the addition of "//URL..." on the
end.  This "//URL..." is the full URL of the now-saved image.  . THis packet being
injected into the APRS global  Internet System (APRS-IS) is now available anywhere in the 
world. . The following OBJECT format is suggested:
<P>
<B>
KB2SCS>APRN:;WB4APRnnn*DDHHMMzDDMM.mmN/DDDMM.mmWTDIR/FOV/Subject...//URL...</B>
<P>
Where the original image is number nnn originated by WB4APR, and it was received 
by the KB2SCS APRN node at DDHHMMz and injected into the APRS-IS as an object with
these fields:
<UL>
<BR><B> DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.mmWT </B> is the LAT/LONG and the SSTV symbol "/T"
<BR><B> DIR/FOV </B> is the direction of the camera and FOV is field of view in degrees
<BR><B> Subject... </B> is freefield to describe the picture title or label
<BR><B> //URL... </B> is the URL link to the image
</UL>
<P>
That makes the image then available worldwide within the APRS-IS system
 by the simple reference to the APRS object
 "WB4APRnnn" and then its URL.
