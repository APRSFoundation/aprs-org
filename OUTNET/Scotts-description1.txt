*****************************************************************************

RESULT:  A BLACK BOX  THAT RECEIVES OUTERNET CONTENT  AND CREATES  A WIFI HOT
SPOT THAT MAKES THAT CONTENT AVAILABLE TO ANY SUROUNDING USERS WITH A BROWSER

The system consists of an Antenna, an LNA, a Receiver (SDR) and a processor
that feeds a WiFi transceiver.  There are multiple ways to do this:

The LANTERN:  This is an all-in-one including solar power black box made
available from the Outernet folks for $169 or so and it is even solar powerd.

PC Hackers:  There are beta software that can run on various platforms to
do the processing, but are frustrating.  I will leave that to other threads.

THE LOW COST HAM APPROACH:
--------------------------

ANTENNA:  unless you already have an L-band RHCP antenna, the patch antenna 
offered by Outernet (via Amazon) is a fine way to start.

LNA:   The LNA offered by Outernet (via Amazon) does an excellent job.

RECEIVER: I originally used the Outernet SDR dongle sold on Amazon.  Then I
tried the newer metal-case rtl-sdr.com TXCO dongle and my L-band signal 
almost doubled.  Unless my units were flukes, the rtl-sdr.com dongle is best.
NOTE! – unlike the Outernet SDR, the rtl-sdr.com dongle needs a jumper on 
board to be soldered to enable the bias-T to power the  LNA.

PROCESSOR: -Raspberry Pi-3:  Besides being a wonderful little computer for
numerous Ham radio projects, the Pi uses a micro-SD card to boot and store
data.  Changing the micro-SD card completely changes the application.

POWERING IT:  The Raspberry Pi-3 needs at least 2.4 amps from the USB. I do
not recommend using AC-only power adapters because you might want to make 
this system portable away from AC mains. Get an appropriate USB cable, and 
separately an adapter for AC-to-USB power. I used an Insignia brand.

PI CASE: A basic case protects the Pi and simplifies handling/mounting.

MICROSD CARD for the Pi: The Pi’s “hard drive”... so get several. The bigger
the more storage the file system can store.

-------------------------------  SOFTWARE  ---------------------------------
 
The only setup step is to download the latest Outernet Pi operating system.
rxOS .ZIP image from: https://archive.outernet.is/images/rxOS-Raspberry-Pi/
 
First, extract the contents of the .ZIP archive; one of the included files
has instructions.  If using a Windows PC for this task, the utility is:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
 
Once the Pi image is written to the micro-SD card, insert it in the Pi,
connect the antenna, LNA, & SDR, and power up the Pi.
 
Using a personal computer, you will see a new wireless network available.
Connect to the “Outernet” network (no security by default).
Once connected, open a browser on your PC and go to http://10.0.0.1  
 
The Outernet web interface will guide you from there.
 
--------------------------------  USES  ------------------------------------
 
Put it all in a box, take it to the next HAM event and encourage others to
use their WiFi devices to check it out!  Any APRS client that can draw APRS
data from a file, can then display the hourly linked APRS files on its map
or messages, etc.
