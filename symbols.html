<B>SYMBOL UPGRADE 2014:</B>  We are beginning a new update process for the APRS symbol set.  In May 2014, we added many new symbols for 
ships and aircraft to include submarines, torpedoes, Drones and Missiles, etc.  In addition, Hessu, the author of APRS.FI announced at Dayton his effort to re-draw all symbols in a vector format so that they can be zoomed and expanded.  Andrew of YAAC has expanded his symbols to include many of these overlay symbols. (more when available)...
<P>

The original APRSdos symbol set (shown several paragraphs below with black background) consisted of
about 92 primary symbols and 92 alternates.  Those symbols each had at least 8 color
atributes for instant recognition of their immediate state.  Unfortunately, the color atributes were dropped
in many clients when they began to use Windows icons instead of rendered symbols.  Those Windows ICONS used for many years are shown here:
<P>
<IMG SRC="symbols/Icon-set.gif">
<P>

<B>OVERLAYS:</B> An optional overlay character could be applied 
over many of the original Alternates (those highlighted in yellow).  Beginning around 2007 we suggested that the 36 overlay characters 
could also apply to any of the 92 alternates giving us over 3000 unique symbol opportunities.  
See: <A HREF="symbols/symbols-new.txt"><B> symbols-new.txt</B></A>. These
would be displayed on all existing clients as an overlay character on the basic alternate symbol, but clients could begin to draw
additional unique images to represent these symbol/overlay combinations.  Here is an example
of how the original "Runner" symbol was expaneded to represent any number of special symbols
for humans carrying APRS such as a Hiker, Skier, or with Baby-on-Board (proud parents).  Another
example is the House symbol expanded to show Power sources such as Battery, geothermal, Hydro, Solar and Wind
plus the new Clubhouse symbol. 
To document these added overlay symbols a new table format was suggested below:
<P>

<IMG SRC="symbols/FEMA-APRS-symbols.png">
<P>

This set shows the original name and primary and alternate symbol as well as the proposed name
change and new alternate base symbol (if needed).  In this case the Wallcloud alternate symbol
was moved over to a subset of Clouds to free up the 36 possible "Human" options.  This new
symbol set consits of then 92 lines as shown above, each with the definition columns on the left
and then a sparse set of columns showing any unique symbols defined for the overlays.
These 92 lines are broken up into four blocks just like the original APRSdos listings.
That is, the 16 symbols using punctuation, the 16 symbols using the numeral area of the ASCII
table, the 32 upper case symbols and the 32 lower case symbols.
<P>
For example, now we can send the code for a GREEN, RED or YELLOW Flood gauge, or can create a symbol for a water stop if someone came up with a nice graphic.

<P>

<B>Dead-Reckoning:</B> Without the original dead-reckoning included in the original APRSdos, many APRS map displays have lost the original real-time freshness that was intended for APRS displays.  Many systems today do not display even the fundamental COURSE/SPEED leader
on each symbol that shows not only which direction it is headed, but how fast.  Also,
many systems do not keep moving-objects moving.  This is also a fundamental of APRS due
to its sparse sharing of a busy channel.  No one has the luxury of high-rate reporting, so
the receive and display systems were supposed to keep objects moving between updates.  This
is called Dead Reckoning and you can see the effect on 5 of the moving mobles in the
APRS dos example further down the page.  
<P>

<IMG SRC="symbols/map-examples1.GIF"> . . .<IMG SRC="symbols/map-examples2.GIF">
<P>
In the two images above, it is easy to see how
the typical non-DR'ed symbols without CSE/SPD leaders give very missleading real-time information.  While the proper display on the right shows which objects are current, which are old, and where they most likely are located.  Further, the presence of the "anchor circle"
makes it easy to see that these symbols have been DR'ed and about how much time has elapsed since their last update.
<P>

I ask all authors to include this fundamental APRS display function in their creations.  It was added to APRS.FI in 2013 and is very valuable for seeing realtime activity.
<P>

<B>Symbol Expansion 2007:</B> 
There was a major SYMBOL Expansion Proposal in October 2007.  This proposal re-aligns several
weather symbols, to free up several alternate symbol blocks which can then each have up to
36 overlay expansions greatly expanding the APRS symbol set to 3200 or more. Now in 2014
we are beginning to take advantage of this expansion (see first paragraphs above). Please review
these documents.  This substantial expansion of the alternate symbol set to include
overlays on ALL alternate symbols is called APRS SYMBOLS 1.2.

<P> <A HREF="symbols/symbolsX.txt"><B>Current SYMBOLS SPEC</B></A> 
    (version 1.1 plus non conflicting parts of 1.2). .

<BR><A HREF="symbols/symbols-overlays.txt"><B>APRS v 1.2 Expanded Overlays on all symbols in 2007</B></A>.
<P>

As long as new software developers recognize both the old and the new alternate weather symbols
the new APRS1.2 Symbol set will work with little confusion.

<P>
<B>APRS SYMBOL ATTRIBUTES:</B>  One of the most important aspects of APRS is the
display of tactical information on maps using symbols for each station.  Each such SYMBOL
has several ATTRIBUTES that convey additional meanings.  In the original APRS, these additional
attributes were displayed with COLORS and circles.  Some new software has
taken a more simplistic approach and simply usees fixed color ICONS but without any
displayed attributes.  Thus, the
users of these systems are blind to attribute information on their
maps without having to click on each one...  This operator intensive masking of
important information does not do justice in some cases to the original intent of 
APRS information display to the end users.
<P>
The image below is a screen capture of the APRSdos F1-HELP-SYMBOLS screen
showing the user all of the different symbols available.  All of those shown in White can display
most of the additional symbol attributes by their color.  (This image has not been updated recently).
<P>
<IMG SRC="symbols/symbols.jpg">
<P>
This next image is an extracted subset showing those symbols that can be overlayed 
with 0-9, A-Z (Aug09 - and now lower case a-z).  
In this example, they all have the overlay character "3".  As of 2007, 
<A HREF="aprs12.html">in APRS1.2</A> all secondary or alternate symbls can have an overlay.  If not placed on the
symbol itself, they can be displayed to the upper left as shown in the new RADIO symbol
below.  New in August 09, the overlay character may be transmitted in lower case.  
This bit-change indicates a priority position packet which may be used in the future
for traffic management.  See <A HREF="aprs12/priority-bit.txt"><B>priority bit</B></A> page.

<B>ATTRIBUTE TYPES:</B>
All of the symbols shown above are in WHITE which is the representation of the symbol
when it is transmitted by a fully capable APRS platform, usually meaning it can send
and receive messages.  For example, if the station is a dumb-tracker with no message capability
then it is displayed in GRAY.  The following table describes all of the SYMBOL ATTRIBUTES
in APRS and the color used in most cases to convey them on the map.  This list is in ascending
order meaning you start at the top and assign any color that applies.  The last color
applied is the one that sticks.
<P>
<LI> WHITE: . . . . . . . A Full-up APRS station that is message capable
<LI> GRAY: . . . . . . . . A Tracker or other station without message capability
<LI> CYAN: . . . . . . . . A moving station with CSE/SPEED or a Dead Reckoned Station
<LI> BLUE(dark) . . . . The previous position of a MOVED station or object
<LI> YELLOW: . . . . . Your own active OBJECTS you are transmitting to the net
<LI> VIOLET: . . . . . . Objects placed on the map by others
<LI> Dark GRAY: . . .  Old Symbols not updated in the last 80 minutes or more
<LI> BLACK: . . . . . . Old Symbols that have been "killed" by the originator
<LI> RED: . . . . . . . . . Emergency, Alarmed, or otherwise unknown symbols
<LI> CIRCLE: . . . . . . Circles show the size of a position's ambiguity (0.1, 1, 10 or 60 mi)
<LI> ACTIVITY BIT . This bit indicates if an operator is present.  The map can be selected 
                    to show only manned stations
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Nothing <i>requires</i> authors to have <i>multi-color</i> symbols to convey these
additional attributes, but no matter how it is presented, these Symbol ATTRIBUTES are
important information about a SYMBOL on an APRS map that should be conveyed 
<i> somehow</i> graphically to the user (without him having to take action to view it)..
<P>
<B> ACTIVITY BIT:</B> . This bit was proposed in the year 2000 time frame to make it easy to
quickly select a map showing only stations that have an operator present.  Since no consensus
was found, this feature was moved to the
<A HREF="aprs12.html">APRS1.2</A> addendum. . The key features of this activity bit are:
<LI> Is set if the PC has detected any operator activity in the last 10 minutes
<LI> If last posit is older than 10 minutes and operator becomes active, a posit is transmitted now
<LI> If no activity detected, then next posit packet follows the usual APRS decay algorithm 
     down to a minimum of 30 mins.
<LI> The activity bit was proposed to be the <B>CASE</B> of the "N/S" bit in the 
     position packet.  U-case means <I>Operator Present</i>. L-case means <I>not active</i>.
<LI> in 2007, this was changed to suggest the "O" overlay on any symbol would mean an
     operator was present.
<P>

<B>EXAMPLES:</B>
The below APRSdos screen capture displays a number of these features using 12 identical
stations or objects all using the CAR symbol.  Note how valuable these attributes
are to conveying quick meaning to the participants in an event.  It conveys at a glance, who
is moving, who is old, who is an object, what you are responsible for, and
many other important variables associated with the real-time tactical display.
<P>
<IMG SRC="symbols/symbolMap.GIF">
<A HREF="symbols/iconCOLR.jpg">was</A>

<P>
Notice how CAR1 and WB4APR have been deadreckoned since more than a minute has passed 
since their last positions came in.  Therefore their last known position is marked with 
what I call their "anchor circle" and then the Symbol has been moved to where they could
be now based on their last known course and speed. 
<P>
<B>IGate Identification:</B> Since Igates occasionally use a symbol other than
the GATE with an Overlay "I", they can also be distinguished by their periodic
IGATE Status packet.  APRSdos, UI-View and WinAPRS use this to draw a circle
or other distinguishing attribute so that these stations can be clearly identified.

<P>
<B>Ambiguity Plots:</B> . Since not all positions in APRS are known to the same 
precision, a significant attribute of all APRS symbols is the provision to show
the four ranges of ambiguity of 0.1, 1, 10 and 60 nautical miles.  . Notice how 
the object named GUESSED above is not shown with a symbol, but with a circle.  
This is because this station is transmitting or entered with a 1/10th mile ambiguity 
with his position.  The station's symbol does show up at large area scales, but once 
you zoom the map below the scale at which the size of the ambiguity is larger than 
the "size" of the symbol, then the symbol disappears so that there can be no 
missinterpretation by the person viewing that there is precision where
there is not.  These ranges of ambiguity are conveyed just like a written position
is conveyed.  If a position is only known to the nearest degree (60 nm), then only 
the degrees are sent. . If the position is only known to the nearest minute, then
only the degrees and integer minutes are transmitted. . and So on down to Tenths
of a minute.  If all digits are known, then the position conveys the full 
precision inherent in APRS which is to the nearest 100th of a nautical mile or
about 60 feet.
<P>
<B>Ambiguity in the Spec:</B> . There has been lots of confusion over Position 
Ambiguity caused by the poor wording in the spec that can be incorrectly 
interpreted as implying a truncation of digits and a lat/long box of ambiguity. 
. It is  not a <i>truncation</i> and it is not a box. . The position field in
APRS is a string field, not a numeric field. . One should place in that
field by  <I>inclusion</i> only the digits the sender wants the receiver to use.
 . Further
the spec implies that this results in a box of ambiguity. . This is wrong.
because it would imply vastly different sizes of inprecision at the equator
and at the poles. . It is clear that the intent of position ambiguity was
a range in nautical miles, since Ambiguity was defined in the LATITUDE field
only, where the digits do correspond to Nautical Miles. . And they do give
the same circular area everywhere on earth.
<P>

<B>Plotting Position Ambiguity:</B> . The recommended plot of position ambiguity
is shown above for GUESSED. . That is, a circle with a radius of the ambiguity
centered on the given position. (Not centered in a box of LAT/LONG) . Further, the symbol may be displayed as long
as the size of the symbol is larger than the circle of ambiguity.  But on 
higher resolution zooms, when the size of the circle becomes larger than the
size of the symbol, then the symbol should NOT be displayed because it implies
a location at the center which is incorrect.  Only the circle should be displayed
at these zooms. . Further, the "center" location of this circle should be
slightly randomized (say within half the range of ambiguity) so that if there
are many stations reporiting the same location and ambiguity, that all of their
circles will show. . These circles are not intended to be precise sizes or edges of ambiguity,
but simply a graphical representation to the viewer that these positions are
not well known.

<P>
<B>Vicinity Plots:</B>  Vicinity plots are special cases of the ambiguity plots where
the receiving software has received a packet from a new station for which it has no
position information.  In order to add this station to the APRS system, the software
creates a temporary position called a "Vicinity" plot.  This position is assigned a
random position within 1 mile of the first digipeater in his path.  The randomness is
so that multiple such Vicinity Plots can be shown.  The position actually is given a
10 mile ambiguity so there is no confusion by casual observers.  Also, the Vicinity
plot symbol is a big question mark and the callsign is NOT shown on the map unless
"clicked-on". . When a valid position is eventually received, then the vicinity plot is replaced
with the new position. .
<A HREF="symbols/APRSvicinity2.GIF"><B>See an example plot</B></A>.

<P>
<B>Parsing Symbol Attributes:</B>

 Determining the "attribute" of a given
symbol to display is the result of some simple parsing of the various APRS position
fields as shown below:
<P>
<IMG SRC="symbols/sym-types.gif">
<P>
Some have said that it is impossible in Windows to display these attributes using
<i>ICONS</i>, but I would think it would be easy to paint a background
circle with the color and then place the ICON on it as shown below:
<P>
<IMG SRC="symbols/ICONcolor8.GIF">
<P>
<B>SYMBOLS versus ICONS:</B> APRS symbols were not intended to be fixed-sized/color "icons"
but were intended to be whatever it took to best represent the "thing" being represented.
The Hurricane symbol is an example as shown below.  It is very large and covers a very
large area.
<P>
<IMG SRC="symbols/HCsymbol.jpg">
<P>
The Hurricane symbol covers hundreds of square miles and it expands or contracts at
all range-scales (zooms).  The <i>twister</i> symbol is shown at the lat/long of the
reproted hurricane, but then a red circle is shown at a radius of the reported
Hurricane force winds and a yellow circle shows the area covered by tropical storm
winds.  Further, these circles are offset by the vector sum of the wind speeds and
the speed of movement of the storm so that the danger quadrant is bigger than the
leward quadrant.  As you can see, no one can miss the presence of the Hurricane, nor
the area impacted by its winds.  Several other symbols in APRSdos vary with map
range scale so that the area covered is constant, such as Grid Squares, DX spots,
and maybe others.  I wish I had had coding room so that Thuderstorms and most other
weather objects did the same...
<P>

<B>AREA OBJECTS:</B> . Another class of large symbols in APRS are the AREA Objects.  
These are Boxes, Circles, or triangles that can be drawn on the map from any scale
from about 500 feet across to 800 miles across.  THey can be any of the 16 primary 
colors and they can be just outlines of filled.  THough caution should be used with the 
FILLED objects, because they can mask all map features underneath them.  Here is an
XASTIR plot of some examples:
<P>
<IMG SRC="symbols/xastir-areasX.JPG">
<A HREF="symbols/xastir-areas.JPG">Click for full size</A>.
<BR>
Its curious why the filled circle is a true circle, yet the "staging3" 
non-filled yellow circle is painted as an oval.  

<P>

The latest <A HREF="symbols/symbolsX.txt"><B>current SYMBOLS LIST</B></A> is maintained
up-to-date on that web page.
<P>
Just as a frame of reference, it is also interesting to look at the
frequency of usage of the more popular symbols put together by James
Jefferson.  See (
     <A HREF="symbols/iconsZ.jpg"><B>Icon usage data</B></A>).
