We desperately need some AMSAT OSCAR class stations in the
Central USA to complete the RAFT radar fence test ASAP. 

Deorbit is in the next two weeks, much earlier than previous
predictions, and so we will not get another comfortable evening
pass window.  Prime passes now are occurring around 4 AM and
moving earlier (sorry).  Before, we asked for Southern USA.  Now
we realize that someone in most central states have command
potential.  Anyone within about 1000 miles E/W of North Texas or
600 miles north and south are ideal!

Station requirements:
1) OSCAR class tracking 2m beam for up/downlink 145.825
2) Standard AX.25 1200 baud packet
3) Simple HYPERTERM text commanding
4) Familiarity with TNC's and TNC commanding
5) Prepared to record 1 minute of audio heard on downlink

Unfortunately I am going to Dayton this weekend, but we have to
really be ready for this next week and get this test done.  None
of the principals involved in this design can do it because we
all live too far away from the 216.98 MHz RADAR fence
transmitter in North Texas.

Thanks, WB4APR, Bob

We only have 7 days left in this operating period and really do
need a good OSCAR station in the Southern USA in a line from AZ
to GA to conduct this test of RAFT flying through the 80
megawatt radar transmitter beam originated in north Texas.

There is only one viable pass per day per command station
location in the early evening....  The trick is to command the
satellite to turn on its downlink carrier and Radar receiver
exactly 30 seconds prior to passing
through the fence and then having an audio recorder running to
"hear" (record) the tone when we pass through the radar beam.

Commands are a simple CONNECT XXXX at the cmd: propt, then an
exchange of passwords, and then sending a simple typed command
at the right time.

RAFT can he HEARD just fine on ALL FIVE passes leading up to
this last pass per day, so you can test your RECEIVE capability
on any pass, but can only command in the dark (due to
overcharging on batteries makes uplink receier deaf)...

If anyone can conduct this test please let us know.  Only one
person per pass can attempt this, so we want the best gun at the
stick.  Fully conversent at the TNC "cmd:" prompt and preerably
with experimence with the KPC3+ remote-sysop command mode.
