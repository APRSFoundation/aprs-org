Pre-meeting and other USNA:  Prof's Boden, Smith, & CDR Myre
USNA Team Attendance: Orloff, Rose, Kinzbrunner, Bruninga
STP Attendance:  Ballard, Taylor, Ritterhouse, Shaffer

For STP:
 1) Provide a copy of sample NiCd Acceptance Test Plan
     (USNA will have to do Qual tests on Batttery Lot)
2) Send USNA a sample Fracture Control Plan
3) Analyse wire and fuse requirements based on 1.1 amp
    PTC fuses, #24 wire and 135% of fuse rating for nominal
    550 mA operating currents.


For USNA:
1) Prepare Phase 01 Safety Presentation by 3 Dec for about 1 Hr
2) Complete stress analysis of mechanical structure in Ideas using
    the 3 body diagram provided by STP
3) Re-issue Battery Cold Test results with added Test Time-Line profile
4) Identify Molex Connector part numbers for STP to analyze at 550 mA
5) If no action on 1499 by CDR, inform STP for action
6) Look at connector design to mitigate cold problems with connectors
7) Send copy of AMSAT paper to STP
8) Address use of GSE port for powering, chargning and safety in our
    Charge Safety document
9) Based on Mechanical analysis, re-look at stiffining options for corners
10) check that wire is 22759/11 silver teflon
11) Provide Materials list for Safety Review
12) Document coatings:
       Anodizing is MIL-A 8625 Type 2 Class 1
       Aladining is MIL-C 5541 class 3 (same as iriditing?)

For Midshipmen:
Produce follow-up PDR presentation with revisions.  Some of these
will require Bob to fix the originals, then you rebuild the presentation.

1) Add to Time line slides delivery of Flight unit for Testing in May
2)  Update RAFT1 and MARScom slide (for new freq, & solar. Bob will fix original)
3)  Also update Constellation slide for V/V instead of V/U
4) Change title of Audio Spectragram slide to be
    PSK-31 Audio Spectragram of Satellite Doppler
5) Internal Diagram and corner detail.  (Bob re-do original to clean up corner)
6) Raft1 Schematic.  (Bob fix)
7) Raft Ant Springs (Bob fix)
8) Unique Side Panel for Antenna crank and GSE (bob fix)
9) Assembly Fasteners, add 6 per side
10) Solar power budget Revise all numbers, not just bottom ones.
11) Make a Battery Test Time-line plot.  I'll show you an example
12) Make a Mars Schematic
13) Make a Mars Panels and Connectors
14) 212 MHz Receiver title should be 217 MHz NSSS Receiver
15) Dont need UHF plot's anymore.
16) Battery Safety Requirements slide:
      - remove "upright requirement", 
      - Change 120 deg line to read Battery Storage Temps limits are -22 to +122 F
        but convert to degrees C.  Hot case may be as high as 165
