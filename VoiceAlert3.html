Have you ever driven on an all day trip and never found anyone to talk to? 
Have you passed someone with antennas all over the roof of his car, yet, 
can't raise him at all? Have you tried to look through the Repeater Guide to help 
you find a local QSO repeater, but find the listing of 10,000 mostly silent repeaters 
daunting, especially while moving? Remember, statistically, one out of every 
500 cars you pass is another ham! On some interstates, that is one every 10 minutes.

<P>
Now, imagine a HAM radio radar that automatically alerts you to other mobiles
 in simplex range, or a dual band radio with a permanent 3rd full-time nationwide 
Voice Alert CALL channel that is always on. What a joy such a device would be. 
Driving the interstates with such a radio would guarantee you a new LOCAL 
contact on average about every 10 minutes or so! It makes the time fly while driving.

<P> 
<IMG SRC="VoiceAlert_files/D700-4.jpg" align=right>

Amazingly, such radios do exist, and in fact ANY radio with CTCSS can be used this way.
Voice Alert is nothing more that setting your mobile radio to CTCSS 100 on 144.39.  This works, beacuse every APRS mobile in North America that is running Voice Alert is not only listening on that channel with CTCSS 100 but he is also sending out a local simplex once-a-minute packet ping to alert other such mobiles when he is in simplex range!
<P>

The way it works is that every APRS mobile with VoiceAlert is transmitting his once-a-minute
packet with CTCSS 100.  So, of all the thousands of packets on that channel, only the ones
with CTCSS are from mobiles and have not yet been digipeated... meaning they are local, simplex
range if you hear them.  Otherwise your speaker is dead quiet.  This is the "radar ping"
proximity alert feature of Voice Alert.

<P>
But similarly, all those Voice Alert MObies with CTCSS 100 are also monitoring the
channel 100% while mobile and can hear a VOICE call with CTCSS100 just as well.
Thus, it is a full time 100% monitored Voice Alert comm channel for use anywhere
in North America for ximplex mobile to mobile use.

<p>
<B>FREQUENCY ALERT:</B> Since 2004, not only do mobile APRS travelers run Voice Alert, but the
new APRS radios from Kenwood and Yaesu also beacon the selected frequency that the other
band of the radio has set for Voice.  So if you have APRS, you can always see what other
voice band they are listening to and also call them there, even if they are not in simplex
range, but you are both in range of the same repeater indicated.  Not only that, but every
APRS digipeater is also supposed to be sending out FREQUENCY OBJECTS that will show on the
front panel of mobile radios the reeommended Voice Frequencies in the area.\
See  the page on <A HREF="localinfo.html"><B> APRS localinfo</B></A>.
<P>


<B>USING VOICE-ALERT:</B>
<P>


Voice Alert works perfectly for simplex calling. If you set CTCSS 100 and make a call,
every APRS mobile in simplex range will hear your voice coming out of his "normally silent"
speaker (136.5 Hz in Europe).  So make the call on 144.39 and suggesting a QSY 
frequency. He WILL hear you. But there are two very important considerations:
<P> 

1) Your call must be brief and suggesting a QSY (you are sharing the 
channel with hundreds of packets)
<BR> 2) You must announce "Voice Alert" in your call.
<BR> 3) Do not TX with CCSS 100 (136.5 in Europe) if you are not listening for a call! (this means home stations!)
<P>


If you don't say "calling on Voice Alert", the other operator 
(who rarely gets a voice-alert) will hear your voice and will just assume 
he heard you on the other channel of his radio. He will press PTT 
and answer you, but since he is still on his normal Band-B, you will 
not hear him, and he will not be able to raise you, and so communications 
is lost. But if you ALWAYS include "voice alert" in your voice call, 
then he immediately knows to switch to BAND-A before he responds.  His response should always be 
something like "Roger, please QSY to my voice channel of XXX.XXX".
<P>

An even better procedure is for the CALLING station to say "Voice Alert, 
listening on 52".  This way, the responding party does not even need
to respond on 144.39 and risk collision with the packets, but can QSY
immediately to 52 and return the call.  And from there, negotiate a
repeater as you go out of range.
<P>


Thus a Voice-Alert  call takes up only about 4 seconds of air time, yet establishes 
a common frequency for the continued voice contact. Never continue to 
QSO by voice on 144.39. It is discourteous to other users of the 
channel because it may block some of their packets..
<P>


Never leave your rig running with CTCSS-100 (136.5 in Europe) transmitting packets (tagged with CTCSS 100) if you 
are not in attendance and are not listening for a call. This is discourteous because it is like
calling "CQ" and not listening for return calls.  See next paragraph.
<P>

<B>RADIO SETUP:</B> The most important thing about Voice Alert is keeping the
APRS Channel Volume controll turned up, and to avoid inadvertantly turning it down and forgetting
it is down.  Therefore, NEVER touch that volume control!  Control the SPEAKER
 on the APRS channel by programming three APRS channels, and give them
the following names (These frequencies are for North America):
<P>

    CH1 "APRS VA " 144.39 CTCSS 100 . .  <== normal APRS Voice Alert operation
<BR>CH2 "APRSmute" 144.39 DCS XXX  . . .   <== To keep speaker QUIET even with other VA's nearby
<BR>CH3 "APRS raw" 144.39 no tones . . . . .  <== for listening/troubleshooting the raw channel
<BR>CH4 "APRSinpt" . 144.39 no tones +600 <== For high reliability reception of event stations
<BR>CH5 "APRSdigi" . 144.99 no tones. -600 <== For Temporary WIDE1-1 digi operation

<P>

Channel 2 effectively turns off the speaker by using a PL tone or DCS that is different from any other operator, then
you will never hear someone else even if they are running VA and are right next to
you.  So this is your MUTED channel, but note, that you can still be called by
someone who knows your private XXX tone!  So using these 3 channels you can easily
control what you hear on the APRS side of the radio, wihtout ever having to touch
the TONE, or Volume or any other menu.
<P>

<B>MOBILE HAM PROXIMITY RADAR PINGS:</B>
<P>

OK, so Voice Alert is a magic always-on-always available voice calling 
channel for simplex mobile-to-mobile use, but now how do you know when you are in range 
of another Voice-Alert mobile? Well, that is the Proximity Ping function of
Voice Alert.  Remember, the APRS mobile with VoiceAlert set is tagging his packets with a CTCSS 100
tone.  So anyone else that is set to Voice Alert, will hear his once a minute or so
packets as if they were a free PING to alert others he is in simplex range!
 (136.5 in Europe).
<P>

Yes,  you will hear an occasional ping.  But ONLY when someone else with Voice Alert is in 
simplex range *and* is also listening with CTCSS 100.  SOmtimes you can drive for hours
and not hear anything.  But if you have Voice-Alert set, you will not miss it when another
Voice Alert mobile passes by.  ENjoy Ham radio... make a voice contact!

<P>
Do not be confused by all the wall-to-wall packets on the channel.  Those are all
digipeated packets and none of them will have CTCSS 100.  Only the once a minute one from another
Voice Alert mobile in simplex range.. a rare event, but one you will now not miss!
During my 30 minute commute, I may only hear 2 or 3 Voice-Alert 
packets total, and then only if Skip, or Todd has gotten in his car and passes me! 
(the other two hams in the county running Voice Alert that I get within a 
few miles of on my commute).
<P>

Again, your speaker is silent 99.9% of the time when there is no other
Voice Alert nearby.  But even when one is near during that other 
0.1% of the time? Only a single SHORT packet, once every 1 to 3 minutes 
and ONLY if someone else running Voice Alert is in simplex range. 
If you are passing each other at 60 MPH each, you will not be in simplex 
range for more than about 3 to 5 minutes maximum anyway. Think of these 
few packets you hear as "pings" from neighbors wanting to chat. 
<P>

If you go to a hamfest and are surrounded by other APRS VOice Alert mobiles
and dont want to hear the other pings, then disable Voice Alert (not volume down) by simply changing from the
144.39 CTCSS 100 channel to 144.39 CTCSS xxx.  No one else is using
CTCSS xxx and so you will not hear anything.  THis gives you slience
but allows you to still keep the volume turned up in case somone wants
to call you with your private Tone xxx.

<P>


<B>VOICE ALERT FOR EVERYONE:</B>
<P>

OK, so this is an "APRS thing" right? No. Anyone can use Voice-Alert to detect someone else in range.
 That is, if you are mobile, can't raise anyone on 146.52, and 
don't have anything else for your single channel voice radio to do, 
then just put it on your 144.39 CTCSS-100 (136.5 in Europe) memory channel
 and your "radar" receiver will be on. 
If any other APRS Voice-Alert mobile gets in range of you, his "pings"
 will wake you up for a nice local simplex QSO. So, even though only the 
APRS Voice-Alert mobile stations will be "pinging", there is no limit 
to how many others can be listening. And since most serious distant 
travelers run APRS anyway, the chances are good you will run into 
someone using it.
<P>


<B>BASE STATION USE NOT DESIRED!:</B>
<P>

Notice, that ALL mobile voice alert stations are guaranteed to have an 
OPERATOR PRESENT (the Driver).   And since Voice Alert is an AUTOMATIC CQ system,
then it is an abomination to  be running VA and to *not* be present to answer
any calls.  And this will happen if you run VOice Alert from a fixed sttaion
or shackj.  This will kill the fun, 
convenience and practicality of Voice Alert when people hear a ping, make a call
and get no response.  Not only is is an irritant to 
everyone in range but they will turn off Voice Alert and all is lost in that area.
<P>


In Washington DC, for example, there is a station running voice 
alert 100% of the time. This means whenever you are in town, 
you will hear a packet every minute over a very large area 
(his base station antenna has 10 times the coverage of a mobile).
This forces routine mobiles entering DC to turn down their
 Band A voice Alert volume most of the time (becuse this guy never answers).

Then they forget to turn it back up when they leave Washington DC. Thus, 
this single fixed station has killed voice alert in that area. 
Oh, and if you try to raise him,
 there is never any answer, because he is not home.
<P>


Conversly, a mobile is 1) Guaranteed to have an operator, 
2) who is listening, 3) is always moving when operating, so he does not 
QRM the same area continuously, and 4) his PL 100 (136.5 in Europe) packets are 
doing what they are supposed to, that is, alerting you to his passing presence.
The only ways a base station can monitor Voice Alert are:

<P> 1) Using a voice -only radio or scanner or receiver (not connected to their packet system)
<BR> 2) Using a radio with SEPARATE CTCSS and TX PL tones, so that packets are not transmitted 
with PL 100 (136.5 in Europe)
Such radios are IC-706, HTX242,
<P>


<B>WHATS WRONG WITH 52?</B>
<P>

So how is this different than 146.52? Easy. With combined passing 
velocities of almost 140 MPH, two passing mobiles will only be in 
simplex range of each other for about 5 minutes or less. Unless both 
of you are calling "CQ-52" every 2 minutes or so, you may pass in 
the night and never know the other person was in range. Also, you 
cannot run CTCSS on 146.52 or you won't hear anyone. Thus, 
your radio does open squelch when you encounter any external 
QRM. Your reaction is naturally to turn the volume down. This is 
another great way to miss a QSO. You may drive for hours, not 
remembering that you turned the volume down. But with CTCSS-100 (136.5 in Europe) 
on 144.39, you will never hear any QRM. The only thing you will 
hear will be others like you. Yes, QSY to 52 for the QSO, but use 
the HAM Radio Voice Alert RADAR on 144.39 as the alert!
<P>


<B>HOW VOICE ALERT WORKS:</B>
<P>

Notice, that this only works easily with radios that have their 
TNC's connected to the discriminator in front of any CTCSS 
Squelch systems. The Kenwood D7 and D700 radios work 
perfectly this way due to their built-in fully integrated APRS TNC's. 
This is because the TNC's listen to the radio prior to the CTCSS 
tone squelch system so that whether or not the CTCSS is set, will 
not affect normal APRS operation in any way. The only thing 
impacted by CTCSS-100 (136.5 in Europe) is the speaker. Thus, it works perfectly
 for Voice, and perfectly for packet at the same time. 
Other APRS mobiles that use external TNC's cannot set 
CTCSS-100 (136.5 in Europe) without killing their packet receive capability because their
 TNC is connected to the speaker. However, the serious mobile 
traveler can easily overcome this restriction if he uses the external 
discriminator connector on his radio for his external TNC. 
This way, his TNC also can hear all packets prior to the operation 
of the CTCSS tone squelch system which only impacts the speaker.
 In this way, he too can run Voice-Alert with CTCSS-100 (136.5 in Europe) muting 
his speaker while allowing APRS mobile packet to work as well.

<P>

But it is important to note that a direct discriminator (or 9600 
baud data connection) in many radios does not have the normal 
FM de-emphasis circuit. Thus, it will skew the packet tones and 
degrade performance unless you add a resistor and capacitor to 
de-emphasize the audio before getting to the TNC. Fortunately, 
many TNC's have an internal jumper labeled something like 
"audio equalization" which can be configured to add the de-emphasis
 inside the TNC with no hardware mods other than moving the jumper. 
Some TNC's may work OK as is with the discriminator also. 
You may as well give it a try!
<P>


<B>VOICE ALERT OPERATING RULES:</B>
<P>

The tremendous power of APRS Voice Alert also carries with it 
some responsibilities of proper operation. The rules are simple 
and should be obvious to anyone who thinks about how the system works:
<P>

1) Program your radio with three APRS channels for easy switching.  
One with CTCSS 100 (136.5 in Europe, one with your own XXX CTCSS and one with none.
<BR>
2) APRS Voice Alert is for "ATTENDED OPERATIONS ONLY". 
Never leave it on unattended.
<BR>
3) An unattended Voice Alert station is a NUISANCE to everyone for miles around.
<BR>
4) NEVER transmit PL-100 (or 136.5) packets unless you are ACTIVLEY LISTENING with CTCSS.
<BR>
5) Voice-Alert is a calling channel ONLY. QSY immediately to a normal voice channel.
<BR>
6) ALWAYS say "voice alert" in any PL-100 (or 136.5) voice transmission to minimize confusion on receipt
<BR>
7) NEVER turn your 144.39 speaker volume down.  To silence another nearby VA station,
change to your APRSmute channel instead.
<P>
Transmitting CTCSS-100 (or 136.5 in Europe) Voice Alert with your volume down is like 
sitting in the middle of a DX pileup calling CQ with your speaker 
disconnected. It is discourteous to everyone. Do not do it. 
If you want to turn your APRS Voice Alert volume down, then turn off CTCSS first.
<P>

<B>REGIONAL CROSS-BAND VOICE-ALERT:</B>
<P>

It is entirely reasonable to set up a crossband Regional APRS Voice Alert system,
so that you can call ALL APRS Voice Alert mobiles over large areas, 
not just simplex.  This is easily
done by placing a cross band repeater at a very high central location with a UHF
radio on the UHF APRS Voice calling frequency (445.925
PL 100 (136.5 in Europe) if available in your area) connected back-to-back to a 
VHF radio for Voice Alert.  Operate the
VHF radio split, transmitting on Voice Alert 144.39 T100 (or T136), but Receiving on 
the national calling channel of 146.52 CTCSS 100 (or 136.5 in Europe).
<P>
This way, a mobile needing to make a call-up to all APRS Mobiles in the area, can
simply call on 445.925 and all Voice alert mobiles will hear him.  They will call
back on 52 with TONE 100 (or 136 in Europe) to establish contact and negotiate a repeater to complete
the call.  The reason for the TONE on 52, is so that the crossband repeater
is not relaying all normal 52 regional traffic onto the 445.925 channel.  As before,
the caller must make it clear what he is doing.  The call should be of the form:
"WB4APR crossband Voice Alert, listening on 52 TONE 100" (or 136 in Europe), so there is no ambiguity
in the response expected.
<P>

<B>FAMILY VOICE-ALERT</B>
<P>

Of course, another use for APRS Voice Alert is to put the wife's 
APRS vehicle on the same CTCSS XXX as your APRSmute channel.  This lets you and your
wife have a private simplex calling channel and range detector!
 This way, you can monitor 144.39 from home 
with that family CTCSS and detect when she is in the neighborhood. 
This is useful for running from the shack to the Kitchen and washing 
dishes or something so it doesn't look like you were spending all day in the shack.
<P>


<B>OTHER APRS MOBILE FUNCTIONS:</B>
<P>

Notice that none of this article has said anything about the all the 
additional mobile uses of APRS and the contents of the packets. 
Entire Encyclopedias of information have been written about all the
 joy and potential of using APRS for all Ham radio applications, 
both on the open road and locally so such a dissertation would be 
beyond the scope of this article. However, we would be remiss if we 
did not at least mention some of the great benefits to the traveler 
of having a radio with a front panel text display that can display 
local tactical information to the traveler.
<P>


<B>OTHER MOBILES ON APRS:</B>
<P>

Of course the Kenwood D7, D700's and now Yaseu APRS radios both capture the data from 
all other mobiles in range and maintain a constantly sorted list 
of the last 40 to 100 stations heard. This list shows up on the front panel 
with a single press of the LIST button as shown in the figure below.
<P>
<IMG SRC="VoiceAlert_files/D700-6.jpg">

<P>
In this example there are not only 4 other stations shown in the list, 
but also the frequency of the local "travelers Voice Repeater" 
is also shown as an APRS object. This is very handy for a distant 
traveler entering a new area. If the operator clicks on that object, 
he gets additional information about that voice repeater, such as 
offset, PL and any regularly scheduled nets. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="VoiceAlert_files/D700-8.jpg">

<P>
For more info on the display of local information on the front panel 
of the mobile travelers radio, please see the two web pages:
<P>


<LI><A HREF="localinfo.html"><B> All about the local info initiative</B></A>
<LI><A HREF="TWP.html"><B> Tiny-Web-Pages for HAM info on the radio display</B></A>
<P>


After selecting a given station from the LIST, you get a full page 
of information on the D700 or up to 5 additional three-line pages 
of information on the D7 HT as shown in the figure to the right. 
This one shows KE4NYV-7 is an HT operator that is 121 miles 
to the Southwwest. These pages show you all kinds of useful information:
<P>

<IMG SRC="VoiceAlert_files/D7icon10.jpg" align=right>

     1) Type of ICON (Car, boat, jeep, airplane, bike, truck, van, etc)
<BR> 2) Distance and range from you
<BR> 3) Grid Square if you are interested
<BR> 4) Time of receipt
<BR> 5) Up to 20 (D7) or 28(D700) characters of status text
<BR> 6) His course and speed (you can see if he is approaching you are already passed)
<BR> 7) His LAT/LON. (usually ignored, since his posit will displayed on your GPS map automatically)
<P>

Normally, it's a good idea to use your 20/28 characters of packet
 text to announce your Email address if your are a fixed station, 
or your Band-B voice frequency if you are mobile and keeping up with it. 
Otherwise, just set your text to say "144.39 PL-100 Voice Alert" (or 136 in Europe).
<P>


<B>IRLP and ECHO-LINK NODES:</B>
<P>

A recent boon to the traveler is the worldwide network of IRLP and 
ECHOlink nodes that give the mobile traveler almost worldwide 
voice access as long as he knows where they are. But with 
thousands of nodes, this is becoming an almost impossible 
administrative task while mobile. Fortunately at our urging, both 
IRLP and ECHOlink have added APRS beacon capability to their 
software so that with the simple configurations, the node can announce 
itself on APRS. This way, the mobile traveler in simplex range of 
such a node can be alerted immediately not only to the presence 
of a nearby node, but also to the Frequency, PL and status of the 
node in real time!
<P>


A properly configured IRLP or ECHOLINK node will show up 
on a D700 front panel. Since the Node type and number are 
included in the APRS Object name, then this information shows 
up clearly on the station LIST and also the additional information 
of the Frequency, PL and Status show up when it is selected as 
shown in Figure 5. Like any other object in APRS, its distance and 
bearing from you is also shown. This is very handy for visiting 
mobile operators.
<P>

Figure 5. (A dual shot showing both the LIST display and the Station display with a node on it)
<P>


The node status is transmitted once every 10 minutes or once 
every time the node changes state. When the node is connected
 to another node, that information is shown as well. You might 
think that a once every 10 minute packet is an added load on 
an already busy 1200 baud channel. But this is simply not the case. 
These NODE status packets are only transmitted DIRECT, locally 
to only those mobiles in usable simplex range of the nodes site. 
This only adds about 0.1% additional "local" load and this kind 
of local, real-time usable information is exaclty what APRS was 
designed to do in the first place!
<P>


<B>MOBILE SATELLITE OPS:</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="VoiceAlert_files/D7sat14.jpg" align=right>

Another thing you will see on your APRS radio front panel is an 
occasional alert when ever an FM satellite workable from your 
mobile is in view. Just like for Nodes, not only is the distance 
and bearing to the bird calculated and shown for your station, 
but also the uplink an downlink frequency and instantaneous 
Doppler as well! (as shown here). These packets are transmitted by a local station 
running the APRSdata.exe program to all mobiles in range. 
Back when UO-22, Pcsat, ISS, SAREX, SUNSAT, AO-27 
and UO-14 were all alive and workable from any dual band or 
packet mobile, these LIVE alerts to satellites in view were very handy. 
These days, only GO-32 is working reliably, but it uses 9600
baud which is perfect for the D7 or D700. 
<A HREF="GO32-ops.html"><B>see GO-32 APRS info</B></A>. 
It is nice 
to get an immediate alert whenever GO-32 is overhead and 
a reminder to its frequencies right there on the front panel of 
your radio no matter where you are and without you doing 
a thing to get it.
<P>
<IMG SRC="VoiceAlert_files/D700all12.jpg">
<P>
<IMG SRC="VoiceAlert_files/D7dx16.jpg" align=right>

But in addition to the while-in-view packets, the APRSdata 
engine in the area also transmits once every 10 minutes a 
schedule of ANY other satellites that my come into view in the 
next 80 minutes as shown in figure 7. This brief packet does not 
clutter up your APRS message list, but is captured into the D7 
or D700 DX Cluster list. There, as long as the radio is not 
turned off, you will always find the latest schedule of any
 interesting satellites you might want to work in the next hour or so.
Figure 7. The D7 DX list display showing the next three satellites 
that will be in view in the next 80 minutes and the TIMES 
of the start of the next pass.
<P>


<B>WEATHER:</B>
<P>

Of course, since APRS was invented in 1992, local Weather has 
always been of particular interest to mobile operators. 
Any home APRS station with a weather instrument usually 
transmits his local weather conditions in his position packets. 
These are captured in the D700 or D7 lists as well and are 
available to the mobile operator. They not only show the distance 
and bearing to the home weather station , but also the wind speed 
and direction, temperature and rain in the last hour as shown in figure 8. 
This is very handy for the distant traveler to see what the 
weather looks like in front of him.
<P>


Figure 8. (a Weather station)
In addition to home weather stations, National Weather Service warnings 
and watches are also transmitted on APRS for local users. 
These are transmitted as bulletins or messages and will show 
up as shown in figure 9.
<P>


Figure 9. (a Weather Warning)
<P>


<B>EMAIL:</B>
<P>

Of course you can also send and receive APRS messages with the 
front panel of these radios. This is routine. But the more useful 
function of APRS messages for distant travelers is to send Email 
back home to family about the progress of the trip. As shown in 
figure 10, and APRS message addressed to the address of "EMAIL" 
will be picked up by the worldwide APRS system and captured 
by the Sproul's WU2Z packet engine and converted into a 
standard Email and forwarded through the internet. If this process
 is successful, you will get an acknowledgement in real time.
<P>


Figure 10. (a dual shot showing the outgoing Email message and the Return WU2Z ack).
<P>


<B>HAMFESTS AND EVENTS:</B>
<P>

Of course, with APRS, you will never miss a local HAM event that
 is in range of you. Anyone running such an event, usually puts up an 
APRS bulletin or OBEJCT alerting everyone in range of something 
happening. Figure 11 shows a HAMFEST object and a Meeting Bulletin.
<P>


Figure 11: (Shows a HAMEST object with talk in frequency listed, 
and a Bulletin screen announcing a (local meeting TOINGHT and the subject)
<P>


<B>TRAFFIC CONGESTION:</B>
<P>

All of the above features are working and on the air in some places. 
But the one dream of APRS for mobile commuters is the placement 
of TRAFFIC objects on the map where ever traffic accidents 
or slow-downs occur. APRS has a special ICON just for 
this purpose. The ICON is a "speed sign" that appears 
on the map beside the road showing the speed of traffic past 
that point. Figure 12 shows how these would appear on the 
Kenwood D700. Anyone can post these objects manually, 
but the holy grail is to have it automated. We considered radar 
devices as sensors or even just capturing the speed of any other 
APRS operator that passed the point, but these days it should 
be trivial for someone to write the software to simply check the 
State Highway Departement's WEB page and mine the speed 
data from their speed measuring system and then have that 
software simply convert the data to the APRS object format 
and send it out via an attached TNC.

Figure 12: (Shows an OBJECT labeled "Route-50W" with
 text saying "speed slowed to [15]MPH")

<B>CONCLUSION:</B>
<P>

Although APRS has pretty well caught on to most of the HAMS 
interested in playing with computers and packet radio, 
we still find that most of the other 95% of ham radio operators 
really do not fully understand what APRS is all about and 
that in reality it is not just a mobile vehicle tracking system. 
Since the day it was invented, it has always claimed to be, 
and remains, a LOCAL Tactical Real Time Digital Communications 
system designed to deliver immediate up-to-date information 
to all stations in range an d particularly to the mobile operator. 
With the front panel displays of almost 250 pages of information 
on the D7 HT or the 65 or more dense pages on the D700, 
there is still lots of potential for delivering even more useful data 
to mobile travelers as they come in range of your HAM radio assets.
