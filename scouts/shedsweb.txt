SHACKS FOR PACKS (& Troops & Posts)

This list assures that everyone's contribution is accounted for
and all monies for this project are received and dispursed in a
manner open to public audit.  To that end, donations are tracked 
by donor number and a separate Donor List  If you contribute, 
you will be notified of your donor number.

In the first post, we did not ask for Pledges so I put in a
nominal $20 as a placeholder until I get better numbers.
Also, we still do not want any checks until we have approval 
for this project.  Dont send money yet.

Once we begin collecting gifts and spending the contributions, those 
expenses will show up below.  Thus, this page will balance the books.
And as will be seen, all monies will go to the SHACKS project at the
SCOUT camp (BSA), and so are tax deductible.
