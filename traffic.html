<B>SUMMARY:</B>
APRStfc.exe is a version of APRSdos with a very simple
method for reporting traffic speeds to <i>local</i> mobiles and commuters.  Only
one copy of APRStfc needs to be running in a <i>local metro</i> area to serve all the
local users and SPEED-POSTS for that area.  Here is what they see:

<P>
This was the original intent of the APRS SIGN-POST Symbol we introduced back in 
1995 for showing
traffic Speed data to APRS travelers nearby. The problem has always
been, how to determine the speed of traffic.  In the past, I tried or
suggested Radar guns, Acoustic signiture and DSP, or OBJECT posting by
observers, and recently just data-mining of such data available on the
internet.  But for years, no one had developed the data.
<P>
<B>MY SIMPLE SOLUTION:</B>  Use APRS! We just added some code to preserve 
the speed data of existing APRS mobiles when they pass through a known 
<i>choke point</i>. APRStfc then adds these speeds to these sign-post objects
at those locations so that they are retained and visible to others over
the next 30 minutes or so.  
<A HREF="traffic/traffic.txt"><B>(see TRAFFIC.TXT description)</B></A>.
Below is a
screen shot of APRStfc this morning.  It's 0934 AM and after rush hour,
so only one Speed-Post object is still active.  But also note the
power of APRS dead-reckoning symbology in clearly showing the state of the
mobiles, where they might be with the passage of time and how old their
last reported position is relative to their speed...

As you can see, APRSdos is not generally focused on great MAP detail, but is
focused on presenting the relative positions and immediate useful tactical
information about your APRS communications net which some recent APRS clones
seem to have overlooked.  Here are the salient parts of this traffic monitoring system:
<P>
<LI> APRStfc monitors 144.39 for all moving objects with speeds (within its area of interest).
<LI> APRStfc has a list of TRAFFIC choke points that it wants to monitor. (TRAFFIC.HST file)
<LI> APRStfc compares each new Vehicle POSIT to each Choke Point location
<LI> If a vehicle passes within say 1 mile of a Choke-Pt... AND
<LI> If it is going within +/- say 10 degrees of the desired direction... THEN
<LI> APRStfc captures the SPEED and places it and the TIME on a sign-post object at his location
<LI> APRStfc begins uplinking the SPEED-POST object using the normal APRSdos decaying algorithm for new data.
<LI> The object disapplears after 30 minutes if it is not updated by another vehicle passing by.
<LI> APRStfc uses a one or two hop digipath to only serve its LOCAL area an minimize channel load.
<P>
The result is that all APRS travelers will see these SIGN-POSTS and will
see on their map, the speed and direction of the traffic flowing past.
Kenwood users won't see the speed on the generic Symbol on their GPS, but the
speed will be clearly visible on the <i>flash</i> page that displays
when a new packet comes in, or later in the list as shown below:
<P>
<IMG SRC="D7xx/D7speed.gif">
<P>
On the D700, which can display 8 more characters of object text,
the callsign of the actual vehicle that triggered the Speed post will also show.
<P>
<B>SPEED-POSTS:</B> Notice that the name of the SIGN-POST OBJECT is the physical name of
where the post is located (as shown on a Kenwood, but NOT on the map).  
For example our biggest commuter choke point
is Route 50 in Bowie.  So the SIGN-POST for that location might be
"Bowie-50W"  (meaning west-bound) then the commuter simply looks through his
Kenwood station list for the SIGN-POST name along his commuting route and
clicks on it and boom... he sees the data...  Just what APRS was designed
to do...  Or if someone else asks about traffic in some other area, an APRS
mobile can find the info on his radio and report by voice.
<P>
<IMG SRC="traffic/tfc-sign.gif"> 
<BR>
<B>SYMBOL Characters:</B> The bytes for a SIGN-POST Object are "\m" and the "61" is
placed on the sign by the format "{61}" in the object text.  Also
so that the Direction of the sign post will show on the map the object
can have a CSE and SPD.  This requires a mod to APRS so that it
does not dead-reckon this sign object!  ALso, the SPEED is shown in MPH
whereas the normal speeds in APRSdos are Knots on the air.  Further, these
signposts should not clutter the maps above the 8 mile scale, and should 
automatically die from receiving systems after an hour.
<P>
<B>MITIGATING QRM:</B>  This system has several features that mitigate any concern
about added QRM on the channel.  It assures that only new data is transmmitted
frequently and that old data quickly fades out of the system.  Also full speed moving
traffic has a lower probability of triggering a SPEED-POST object as follows:
<P>
<LI> First, it uses the APRSdos decaying algorithm so that old data is repeated less and less often
<LI> Second, the 1 mile capture area wont trigger on fast vehicles using >2 minute rates
<LI> But slow traffic <24 MPH even if at a 5 minute rate will be captured.
<LI> Objects disappear after 30 minutes
<LI> APRStfc uses only a one or two hop digi path, only suffcient to cover the
     area it is monitoring.
<P>
<B> BUILDING the SPEED-POST FILE:</B>  Another neat feature is the ease of building
the data file that tells APRStfc where all the choke points are.  It should only 
take a few minutes in any area!  Just move the cursor to each location where
you want to know the speed of traffic and ADD an object there, including its
diretion of interest and range as shown below.  Then simply do a normal APRSdos SAVE and
the history file will contain all of these points.  Then just name that history
file as TRAFFIC.HST and APRStfc will then use this file as its knowledge
base for where to watch for moving traffic.
<A HREF="traffic/trafficHST.txt"><B>See TRAFFIC.HST details</B></A>.
The map below shows as an overlay, where all the "sensor objects" are located in
the Wash DC area.

<P>
Thus, it is trivial to setup, trivial to operate, and runs on any old PC or laptop
you have laying around.  Plus it is a full APRSdos program, so it can also be used
to  monitor your local APRS situation too...
<P>

<B>USING UIVIEW TRAFFIC-ADD-ON:</B> A version of APRStfc has been written as an add-on
for UIview which attempted to provide this functionality,
but at the time, I have seen some significant errors in its application.  It supposedly
"simplifies" the specification of the check-point file, by allowing the user to 
simply select an intersection and then it will generate speed post signs from all four
directions.  But if the users takes this "short cut" his on-air result will more often
than not be completely wrong!  It is very important that sysops understand that the center 
of an intersection CANNOT be a checkpoint!  Here is why:
<P>
<LI> The location of the slow-down is different in the morning and evening
<LI> The direction of the slow-down is different in the morning and evening
<LI> If you want to flag all four approaches to an intersection (rarely) then you must have FOUR
   separate and independent check-points for the four separate approach directions and locations!
<LI> If you checkpoint the center of the intersection, you will equally well capture the
speed of an APRS mobile AFTER he has cleard the slow-down and thus give a very wrong
"high speed" when in fact, the traffic was SLOW as he was approaching.
<LI> Checkpointing the center of an intersection also generates 4 times the QRM on the channel
when usually only one direction in the morning and one direction in the evening are needed. 
<P>
I could not convince the author that allowing users to take the simplistic center of an 
intersection would end up doing more harm than good and should not be an option.  SYSOPS should
be forced to very carefully plan their checkpoints at the APPROACH to intersections where
the actuall slow-downs occur.  Maybe he eventually fixed it.  I am not sure.
<P>

<B>INSTALL APRS-TRAFFIC:</B> Only one person in each metro area needs to run APRStfc.
 To install and run APRStfc, you must first have APRSdos
up and running, then install TRAFFIC.ZIP.  <A HREF="install.txt"><B>See how</B></A>.

<P>
<B>FUTURE WORK!!!</B> We need someone to decode the Maryland CHART information
which provides traffic data for over 60 locations in the DC/Baltimore area.
Then we would always have up to date info.  Here is the link to the Maryland
<A HREF="http://www.chart.state.md.us/travinfo/speedData.asp"><B>LIVE SPEED DATA</B></A>
.  All we need is someone smarter than I to simply write a parser to read the
SOURCE from this web page once every 5 minutes and then to POST suitable SPEED-POSTs
at the locations of any speeds that are say less than 30 MPH...  To see how easy
it is, simply "view-source" while you have the page displayed and look at the data
near the end.  Its all there!
<P>
<B>PARSER and RESULT:</B> Here is the very simple parser I wrote in BASIC
and its output.  Now all we need are the LAT/LONGS of these points and then
an APRS traffic server can put out the SPEED-POSTs for those that are below
the 50 MPH threshold!
<A HREF="traffic/speedout.txt"><B> See Parser and Result</B></A>.  
I can't do any more, because I can't write an internet reader in BASIC.  Sad..
<BR>But dont worry.  We would not throw all these packets on the net except 
DIRECT from a station NEAR the speed results, so it doesnt QRM the channel...
<P>
<B>APRS TRAFFIC STANDARD:</B> So what we need is to develop this capabiltiy into
every APRS internet capable client so that we can move this volume of data
most efficiently and only bring it to RF for the last link to mobiles in the
vicinity of a local SPEED-POST.  
So, <A HREF="traffic/trafficsys.txt"><B> See the APRS TRAFFIC PLAN</B></A>.
<P>
<B> GROWING PAINS:</B> Unfortunatley not all APRS clones completely implemented
the Sign Post symbol.  This causes users of those clone programs to complain about
too much clutter on the maps when in fact, they should not see the clutter at all.
Here are the salient features of the SIGN POST symbol that were left out of several APRS clones:
<LI> Don't display the speed on the sign
<LI> Don't hide the speed post at zoom scales above the 8 mile range scale
<LI> Don't selectively display the speed post at zooms below the 16 mile scale
<LI> Don't kill the object after an hour
<LI> Don't show the direction of traffic past the sign that it is monitoring
<LI> Don't disable Deadreckoning on Speed Posts (This is new to ALL code.  I had to add it to APRSdos)...
<P>
So users that set up a speed monitoring and diplay system in an area should be
sensitive to the clutter that these other stations might see until they upgrade
and so don't over-do it.  Pick those classic traffic choke points now and add
others later.  And keep the range to about 1 mile so they are not triggered
except when someone is stuck there.  This is a great self-limiting feature...
