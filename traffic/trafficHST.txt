TRAFFIC.HST FILE:

To tell APRStfc where the local traffic choke points are located, I
used the standard APRS .HST file format.  Here are sample entries for
our area (Greater Baltimore/Washington-DC area).

POINT     DAYTIME LAT      LONG      DIR DL  RNG STRT STOP
--------- ------- -------- ------------- --- --- ---- ----
Bowie-W   +123456z3857.00N\07644.00Wm270/010/1.0 0600 0900
Bowie-E   +123456z3857.00N\07644.00Wm090/010/1.0 1500 1800
NwCrltn-W +123456z3856.70N\07648.00Wm270/010/1.0 0600 0900
NwCrltn-E +123456z3856.00N\07654.00Wm045/010/1.0 1500 1800
SevrnBR-W +123456z3901.00N\07629.00Wm270/010/1.0 0600 0900
SevrnBR-E +123456z3859.50N\07631.50Wm090/010/1.0 1500 1800

Here DIR is the direction of travel, DL is the delta angle acceptible
to be considered on that route, RNG is the acceptible range from that
point, and STRT and STOP are the start and stop times of voice
reporting(the times are not currently used).

This exact TEXT format is included so that the Sign-post shows up 
properly on the D7 screen but also additional information is included 
which shows the direction of the traffic lane at that point that is to 
be monitored and the range from that point that is of interest.

APRStfc scans through this list on receipt of any new moving vehicle
position report checking to see if the vehicle is within range of
the choke point.  Interestingly, when traffic slows down to say
30 MPH or less, then even a 2-minute tracker has a very good chance of
being captured in that window (2 packets within a mile of the
choke point)...

MAKING YOUR TRAFFIC.HST FILE:

The easy way to make a TRAFFIC.HST file is to use APRSdos to simply move
your cursor around to the various choke points and hitting INPUT-
ADD-OBJECT and entering the NAME of the SpeedPost.  Then for the COURSE
enter the direction and for the speed, enter the ANGLE LIMIT (typically
10 to 20 deg (plus/minus)).  In the comment field, type the 3 digit
RANGE limit (usually 1.0 miles).  You may also enter the START and STOP
times (thought at this point, they are ignored).  Then FILE-SAVE hitting
"T" to force a TRAFFIC.HST file.  Similarly, you can edit a TRAFFIC.HST
file by using the FILE-NEW command to clear memory, and then using
FILE-LOAD and also selecting "T".  THen you can continue to INPUT-ADD
new SPEED-POSTS or on the P-LIST, edit or delete entries.

Since all of these choke-points do not actually show on the map unless
they have current data, I added a new MAPS-OVERLAYS-TRAFFIC command
which will overlay all of the choke points onto the map temporarily.
These points show the location and a DIRECTION indicator
to help you assess their applicability.

DIFFERENCES TO normal APRSdos version 864:
1) removed Fade-DFing, NTS message formats, GPS and WX interface
2) Upped Capture size from 101 to 173 stations (5 pages)
3) Added MAPS-OVERLAY-TRAFFIC for viewing SPD-POSTS in TRAFFIC.HST file
4) Turned off Dead Reckoning of SPD-POSTS. (should do in all APRS)
5) Users should use JUST-MOBILES command frequently to see mobile situation
6) FILE-LOAD command (if FILE-NEW has cleared memory) can select "T"
   to allow loading the TRAFFIC.HST file.
7) FILE-SAVE command has the "T" option to save TRAFFIC.HST
   (Always keep a backup! because it is easy to overwrite...)
8) CONTROLS MENU (TAB) has CONTROLS-TRAFFIC to toggle on and off
   traffic SPD-POST generation.  The status of CONTROLS-TRAFFIC is shown
   in the middle of the CONTROLS DISPLAY (hit TAB).
