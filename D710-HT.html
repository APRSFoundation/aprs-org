The Display Head for the Kenwood D710 mobile APRS radio contains all of the APRS functionality
in addition to the normal Radio control functions.  But since the TNC and APRS CPU are all in the
Display Head, Kenwood sells it separately as the RC-D710 so that it can be used 
independently with ANY radio, including even 
<A HREF="DSTARdisplay.html"><B>the Dual band DSTAR</B></A> radios.  
When detached from the D710 radio and used stand-alone, the default display screen is no longer
the dual-band frequencies, but an APRS summary as shown above.  It shows the number of each
type of station on the air.

<P>
The image above shows how I attached it to an old $88 Alinco HT for indoors APRS display.
A better method would be to keep the HT separate and just have a 4 foot spkr/mic audio cord over to 
the radio so that the Display Head can be held in the hands for easy communications
and the HT placed in a window or elsewhere for better RF.
<P>

Normally the RC-D710 APRS Display Head when used with other radios
requires the PG-5J Interface Unit.  This unit breaks
out the speaker and audio connections for both 1200 and 9600 baud to any other radio that
supports the common mini-din "data" connector found on most modern radios for plug-and-play
operation.  But more importantly it provides a regulated 10 volts at about 360 mA
to power the Display Head.  When running from 13.8 volts the 10v regulator is disapating
almost 2 watts and so this accounts for most of the size of the PG-5J.  
<P>

Since I only needed SPKR and Mic/PTT for my HT, the mini-din connector was overkill
and so the only thing I needed was to supply the 10 volts power.  Then I could eliminate the PG-5J
and just wire directly to a battery for power and to conventional audio connections.

<P>

As you can see in the photo, 8 AA NiCd cells were bundled together across the back and an
aluminum bracket held them in place along with the DJ-S11 Alinco radio.  A quick disconnect
was provided for the battery not only for charging but because the RC-D710 Display Head
draws about 10 mA even when off, so you don't want to leave the batteries connected unless
you add an external switch.  Notice also the reverse diode protection which should blow
the fuse if you hook power backwards.
<P>

The above photo shows the back of the package with the radio tuned to 144.39 MHz.  Notice
also the aluminum bracket that holds down the "monitor" button all the time.  This is
required on these radios to keep the radio from entering battery-saver mode and pulsing power
to the receiver.  In battery saver mode, the pulsing causes the radio to miss almost all
packets, unless the channel is 100% wall-to-wall busy.  So best to keep this button always
pressed as shown here.
<P>

This final sketch shows how I wired the RJ-45 cable to the HT and battery.  Be sure to provide 
small fuse, and reverse diode protection for the inevitable mistakes.  
I use a 500 mA PTC resettable fuse so I dont have to resolder
a fuse each time I do a booboo.

Remember bypassing the PG-5J interface VOIDS the Warranty on your RC-D710 display!</B>

Of course, you can still connect the AVMAP-G5 for the full APRS map display
with full color ICON set.

<P>


Bringing all this data indoors is very valuable.  The position of this repeater
and all other surrounding ham radio activity (APRS and D-PRS mobiles, etc) 
show up on the attached GPS display.  On the right, 
you can see a 443.375+ repeater along with all the other nearby APRS symbols on the
new Avmap G5 map display that supports the full APRS symbol set.

<B>Attaching an RC-D710 to a DSTAR Radio</B>
<P>

Since the RC-D710 Display can work on any radio, attaching one to a DSTAR
radio is plug-N-play!  Just connect the mini-dins together and set the
DSTAR menu properly for the interface and operate the left half of the radio
in analog (APRS) mode.  Let the RC-D710 perform all of the APRS
functions on the LEFT band of the 2820 radio on 144.39 and let the right side of the 2820
perform the DSTAR functions and DigitalVoice as shown below.  Plug in an AVMAP G5 into the RC-D710
 and you also then get the full color map display and APRS symbols too!

<P>
Now you have it all!  The above photo is from KB2M who says it was just
plug-n-play, just plug the standard DIN audio connection from the D710 display head to the
ICOM radio's DIN connection.  
He had initial difficulty with audio levels, but eventually found that you must use the
MPC program on the RC-D710 to set the TX audio level.  Also, it was noted that the RC-D710
outputs baseband TX levels and so for some radios, an added 1.0 uF capacitor might need
to be inserted in the data line. Jeff found a great location
<A HREF="DSTAR/1uf-installedX.JPG"><B>(see photo)</B></A> inside the PG-5J interface box.
Also the GPS needs to feed both the Icom radio and Kenwood Display head, so the serial line
from the GPS needs to be split to the two ports.  But otherwise it looks real nice!  The
D710 display in this photo is in a rather boring PACKET MONITOR display, just showing raw
packets.  But all the other APRS displays are available.  See Jeff's actual
<A HREF="DSTAR/kb2m1x.JPG"><B>installation</B></A>.

The RC-D710 Display Head only costs $199 and makes a nice APRS addition to any radio.  It plugs
into the TX and RX audio of any radio and turns it into an APRS radio just like the TM-D710
full function APRS radio.  It would be nice to find a 10V regulated source inside the 2820
to power the RC-D710 display, otherwise you also need to purchase the PG-5J Cable/Regulator 
for about $87 to power the display head.  It takes 300 mA at 10 volts regulated.

<P>


<B>CONCLUSION:</B> On long trips, no matter where you are,
we hope you will see not only one of these recommended 
voice repeaters on your screen, but also the nearest IRLP or EchoLink node as well...    
This combined with APRS 
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/voiceAlert.htm"><B>Voice Alert</B></A>
will guarantee that if there is someone nearby wanting to chat, we will find
each other.

<B>P.S.</B> . Oh, there is an 
<A HREF="http://www.usrepeaters.com/maps/index.php"><B> on line repeater lookup</B></A>
system, but it is just like the repeater directory.  So many repeaters, 
so little time to pick out the one that is useable by travelers...
