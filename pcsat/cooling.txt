THERMAL COOLING EXPERIMENT:
---------------------------
 
A resistor on the -Z axis could serve as a heat sink for excess 
solar power and would be a good study project for students.  Sizing 
the resistor to dissipate all solar power in excess of the nominal
average power could allow us to get rid of about 3 watts of heat.

If we don't do anything, then that 3W adds to our peak temperature.
If we switch it to a radiating resistor, then that gives us at least some
thermal control.  Assuming the total solar flux is about 140W through 
our spacecraft, this would give us about a 3.5% control range.  Taking 
the 4th root at a nominal 270 deg K operating temperature, then this 
could equate to a temperature difference of about 3 degrees?

Just my guess.....

So we  put 80 RED LEDS on the bottom of PC sat as a 3W thermal radiator 
for this test.  And just for fun, at night we can also turn them on as 
power permits as a visual experiment.  Calculations suggest a magnitude
of about 6 if it is pointing straight down.  Eight, if it is off to
one side or the other.  Magnitude 8 is visible with binoculars.
