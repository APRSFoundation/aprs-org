KODIAK STAR LAUNCH MONITORING TEAM PLAN           (Draft  19 Sep 2001)
---------------------------------------           (B.Bruninga, WB4APR)

Although Launch is from Kodiak, Alaska, most post launch data will be
derived from dozens of amateur satellite monitoring stations around 
the world who will provide initial telemetry and monitoring data to 
the launch team.  PCsat has no whole orbit telemetry storage on board.
It is dependent on ground based internet linked capture and 
distribution of live telemetry to the command station in Annapolis 
not only during the initial phases, but throughout its life.

For the initial post launch spacecraft on-orbit checkout, the Launch
Monitoring Stations will fall into three categories:

  Packets detected by ear and noted as to exact times of receipt
  Packets copied to file and Emailed
  Packets injected live into the worldwide APRS internet system
  
  
REPORTING:  Telemetry data is shared among the launch team via live
connection to the worldwide APRS Servers, or via Email.  Stations 
connected to the servers can also communicate via Keyboard directly
via APRS messages to the USNA W3ADO command station.  The APRS servers 
are, in order of availability listed as follows:

  AHUBEAST.NET    port 2023   <Use any of the AHUB's or SECOND.APRS.NET
  AHUBCENTRAL.NET port 2023   <since these echo packets back to the 
  AHUBWEST.NET    port 2023   <users that are logged onto the same 
  SECOND.APRS.NET port 23     <server.  Others do not.
  THIRD.APRS.NET  port 23
  FIRST.APRS.NET  port 23

WEB PAGE:   In addition to sending and receiving all packet data there, 
the web page below will also capture packets and make them available
to viewers (although the SYSOP is enroute to DCC and so the page will
NOT be activated until the week after launch)...
     
            http://pcsat.aprs.org should also capture all packets

EMAIL:  Send REPLY mail to the email list already being used or send 
specific email to at least these addresses:

     bruninga@usna.edu           PCsat
     mas@me.wustl.edu            Sapphire
     gilmoore12@aol.com          Starshine

Packet Telemetry listings are preferred to be embedded within the body 
of the email instead of attachments which require multiple additional
processing steps on receipt. 

TELEMETRY:  There are three Amateur Satellites on Kodiak Star.  None 
have any continuous signal, but only occasional packet bursts of
telemetry on the order of once a minute or less.  This makes tuning
and finding these birds somewhat of a challenge.  See tracking section 
later.  Here are the expected packets on the first several orbits:

   Starshine: one 0.3 sec TLM @ 9600 on 145.825 every 2 mins           

   Sapphire:  one sec CW dit-dit Beacon on 437.1  evy 1 min  

   PCsat:     TLM-A   @ 1200 on 145.825* every 1 min       
              TLM-A   @ 9600 on 145.825* every 3 min
              BTEXT-A @ 1200 on 145.825* every 4 min
              TLM-B   @ 1200 on 144.39*  every 3 min
              TLM-B   @ 9600 on 144.39*  every 1 min
              BTEXT-B @ 1200 on 145.39*  every 4 min

Since PCsat's telemetry is multiplexed, it takes a series of
four telemetry packets from each system (A/B) to form a complete
spacecraft telemetry snapshot.  The sequence of each of these four
packets can be derived from either the serial number (sss) or the
two (NN) bits in each packet.  The TNC-A packets use the call of
W3ADO-1,-2 and those from TNC-B use PCSAT-11,-12.  Telemetry 
packets are of the form:

  W3ADO-1>APRTLM,SGATE:T#sss,111,222,333,444,555,11111111,00NN,0
  PCSAT-11>APRTLM,SGATE:T#sss,111,222,333,444,555,11111111,00NN,0
              
Presumably all of the packet timers on PCsat will initialize at the
same time, so the activity should be bunched around the minutes.  Also
the SAFE mode for PCsat has both transmitters cross connected so that
every packet from either TNC will appear on both frequenceis.  Thus
only a single receiver is needed on either 145.825 or 144.39 to
capture all telemetry.

LISTENING to 9600 BAUD:  A 1/2 sec 9600 baud packet is indistinguishible
by ear from open squelch FM noise.  The only way to detect it is by 
having your squelch set above threshold to quiet the speaker.  Then any
9600 baud packet will sound like a brief open squelch.  Please time the
period and relative occurance of these relative to other packets.
Due to the scheduling, most 9600 baud packets from PCsat will occur
immediately adjacent to a 1200 baud packet and so may just sound like 
either a leading or trailing noise burst on the 1200 baud packet.

The STARSHINE 9600 baud burst should be independent of these and
should also occur 5 minutes or more in advance of PCsat on the second
orbit.  This is because Starshine is the last to separate after a  
significant second orbit altitude maneuver to lower it 300 km below 
the other satellites.  Due to this lower altitude, Starshine will be 
going faster by about 5 minutes on the second orbit.  Palmer Station
and then South Africa will be the first to hear these packets and 
must be prepared to differentiate between the single 9600 baud 
Starshine packets and the grouped PCsat packets.

SAPPHIRE:  Sapphire has an initial Beacon mode using a simple CW
dit-dit once a minute.  The presence of these two bursts once a minute 
on 437.100 (+/- Doppler) will constitute proper separation.

TIMING:  Please initialize all TNC clocks to UTC.  The Kenwoods built-in
TNC's do not have clocks, so please keep a written log of time of
receipt on the first orbit or so if possible.  If your packets are 
injected LIVE into the internet stream no time stamp is required.


STATION SETUP:

MINIMUM STATION:  The minimum station simply monitors all packets on 
145.825 at 1200 baud.  If all systems on PCsat are operational, all 
telemetry can be captured there.  But it will take 12 minutes to get 
a complete set of system-B telemetry.  

TWO SYSTEMS: If two receivers and TNC's are available, the best setup
will be to have one at 1200 baud and the other at 9600.  Not only does
this capture data from PCsat faster, it also is ready to capture data
from Starshine on the second orbit.  Since the two spacecraft and
3 TNC's share the same frequency, they will not overlap, so the RS-232
outputs of the two TNC's may be able to be dioded-ORed together into 
the same ASCII capture file.

THREE SYSTEMS:  If a third UHF receiver (no TNC) is available, a
constant monitor on the Sapphire 437.100 downlink by ear should reveal
the beacon dits from that spacecraft.


ANTENNAS:

None of these satellites have attitude control on these initial orbits,
so the polarization will be random.  PCsat does have cross polarized
antennas for all uplinks and downlinks, but the other spacecraft 
downlinks are all linear.  Power from all three are within 3 dB of each
other and should have a few dB link margin.  For comparison purposes,
the packets from these birds should be on the order of 3 dB less than
the existing downlink from the ISS on 145.800 (when it is on)...

Use the ISS as a good means to test your station (and also serve the
worldwide community by serving the downlink into the worldwide APRS
system where it can be seen on http://www.ariss.net.

An omni 2m antenna with minimal cable loss should be sufficient to
capture most of the telemetry when the satellite is in view when the
polarizations match.  But due to the lack of polarization control, a
beam will improve performance.  For Sapphire on UHF, a short beam and/or
preamp may be required to overcome cable loss.  ALso, expect a -7 dB
performance difference on 9600 baud.


LONG TERM:

As noted above, both PCsat, and Starshine represent a new breed of 
amateur satellite that presume a worldwide internet linked ground
station network for capturing whole orbit data on 145.825.  Many
of the dozens of student CUBESATS scheduled for launch in May 2002
and the next two Starshines 4 and 5 tentativley scheduled for Nov 
2002 will also use this technique.  We hope that members of the
Kodiak Star Launch Monitoring Team will consider assembling a permanent
amateur satelltie monitoring station to serve this growing network
of amateur satellites.
