PCsat USER SERVICE AGREEMENT                            10 Dec 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             WB4APR

UPDATE 10 Dec 08: PCSAT is getting old.  It can only operate during
the week long winter periods of full sun.  Even then, an overload
will lose its parameters and the power budget will be lost until 
the next year.  So do not overload PCSAT.

Use of W3ADO-1 DIGIPEATER is not authorized during these restora-
tion periods, because that is the crashed call, and indicates 
PCSAT is in power-negative mode!  Use only the path of ARISS or
WIDE2-2.

SERVICE:

PCsat, NO44 provides a worldwide position, status and messaging 
service for mobile and handheld amateur radio satellite users.  
Grade of service depends on user adherence to Power levels, 
transmission Period, and Precedence criteria.  (Both are currently 
not working to full design, so note changes below).

POLICY STATEMENT:

PCsat are open systems in accordance with the ITU regulations for 
the Amateur Satellite Service.  To provide the best overall 
throughput for the largest collection of users, the PCsat digi-
peater is protocol driven and requires that all users adhere to 
the fundamental protocol requirements.  Users that adhere to 
these published protocol and operating standards are very welcome. 
                                                                    
AGREEMENTS:

You may use PCsat if you adhere to the following agreements:

1) PCsat is for ATTENDED LIVE UI digipeating only.  No CONNECTIONS 
   either TO or THROUGH PCSAT is authorized.  Unattended 
   operations are not welcome (except for validated experiments, 
   Antarctic WX stations and floating environmental buoys.

2) Keep informed of the current protocol requirements via the PCsat
   web page www.aprs.org/pcsat.html or via bulletins in the 
   downlink.  Since the 3 Oct 2001 activation, the requested 
   routine uplink rate is only 1 routine position/status packet 
   per minute.  One-line messages may be somewhat more frequent 
   in a dialog context. 

3) The PCSAT and your objective is to get mobile/HT position or
   status digipeated once or so per pass and to relay a few 
   messages or Email as needed.  Share the resource.  Minimize 
   your transmissions..

4) The PCSAT digi responds to PCSAT-1, ARISS, APRSAT and WIDEn-N.
   With ISS on the same frequency and also suppoting these same
   generic aliases, using ARISS,ARISS or WIDE2-2 is recommended.
   The default W3ADO-1 callsign is a distress callsign and is
   not authorized during potential operating periods (Nov - Mar).
   When PCSAT has no hope of recovery (APR-OCT), that callsign
   may be used since the satellite cannot be recoered anyway.

   Like the terrestrial network, PCsat does callsign-substitution 
   of its own MYCALL to indicate that it has digipeated the packet.
   The ISS does not do callsign insertion on WIDEn-N so ARISS is
   receommended if you want confirmation of digipeat via RS0ISS.

6) Use only the authorized power levels, channel and periodicity for 
   your station class and precedence as posted and published below.

   STATION CLASS   PWR  BAUD  UPLINK   PERIOD   DIGIPATH  DOWNLINK
   --------------  ---  ----  -------  -------  --------  ---------
   Terminal Packet 50W  1200  145.825  2 min    APRSAT    145.825
   APRS Base stn   50W  9600  435.250  2 min    APRSAT    145.825
   Mobile          50W  9600  435.250  various  APRSAT    145.825
   Handi-Talkie     5W  1200  145.827  various  APRSAT    145.825

   The UHF receivers are kept off to conserve power, due to the 
   failure of the -Z solar panel on launch.  Thus the only public 
   uplink on PCsat is 145.825 MHz.  The un-published uplink for 
   the 144.39 downlink system is available for anyone with special 
   needs.

   PCsat can hear well a 5 Watt station using a decent antenna when
   no one else is colliding with the uplink.

7) Routine operations after dark via PCsat are not welcome.  Do not
   use PCsat in the dark unless you have a high priority requirement.

8) Use the shortest possible packets.  Mic-E protocol or APRS
   compressed is preferred (typically 30 bytes or so).  ALso
   Use a short TX Delay (TXD) of about 150 ms or less if possible.

9) Determine your own precedence based on your current communications 
   requirements for each pass.  In general, all use is routine except 
   for special circumstances.  Typical Special usage is for demonstra-
   tions, and long term events.  Priority usage may be for VIP demos 
   or special one-time events.  Use good judgment, being fair to all 
   other usrs.  To alert other users to your precedence/priority, Set 
   your period and position comment as follows:


   STN CLASS    PRECEDENCE  PERIOD  ICON   POSITION COMMENT
   -----------  ----------  ------  -----  ------------------------
   Mobile/HT    Emergency  .2 min   any    EMERGENCY
                Priority   .5 min   any    PRIORITY
                Special     1 min   any    Special
                Routine     2 min   any    Off-duty,Enroute,...,etc
   Termnl Pkt*  ALL         X * 2   N/A    Short BText 
   Base Stns    ALL         X * 2   House  Off-Duty
   GPS Traker   ALL         X * 2   GPSxyz N/A

   Notice that terminal packet stations, base stations, and NMEA Trackers 
   are requested to minimize QRM by setting their packet rates
   to the next longer period (twice as long) for any given precedence 
   to account for their longer packets.

CRASH MODE:  Whenever PCsat crashes to W3ADO-1, we ask that all user 
transmissions other than Emergency and Priority traffic cease.  CRASH
mode sets the W3ADO-1 call, turns on the two backup UHF receivers and
cross connects the transmitters and sets the Telemetry nits to 11111111.
*** During normal OPS periods.  DO NOT USE W3ADO-1 callsign!
*** During the summer you may use W3ADO-1 since there is no chance of
    recovery except during full sun periods in the late fall and winter.

Remember, for now, no unattended operations are authorized.  Also night 
time operations via PCsat will kill it.
