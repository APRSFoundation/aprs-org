ISS-PCsat JOINT CONSTELLATION TEST                             28 Oct 2002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                    WB4APR

On 10 October the ISS crew changed the ARISS packet radio system frequency
from 145.800 to the PCsat frequency of 145.825 for the first experiments
in the Amateur Satellite Service with two digital communications
spacecraft operating in constellation with each other.  Both spacecraft
were configured to relay digital packets between ground users and each
other to accomplish the following objectives:

  1) Doubling the channel access times for all users from as low as 50
     minutes (6 passes a day) with a single spacecraft to as much as  2
     hours (12 passes a day) with both.

  2) Operating identically and generically so that users could communicate
     with their same station configuration independently of which
     spacecraft was in view.

  3) Operating as a constellation of two for satellite-to-satellite relay
     of user communications to extend the terrestrial range over
     greater distances or from continent to continent.

  4) Operating in support of ech other so that one spacecraft could relay
     to ground stations over the horizon, the telemetry from the other.

  5) Operating synergistically with dozens of worldwide fixed-tuned,
     no-track-omni internet linked ground stations providing near
     worldwide live connectivity to anyone with a browser to monitor the
     mutual downlinks. (www.ariss.net and pcsat.aprs.org).

  6) Establishing a baseline verification of ISS antenna, transmitter and
     receiver performance by comparison with known ERP, antenna and
     sensitivity measurements on PCsat.

TEST LIMITATIONS:

As an experiment of opportunity, there were several limitations on the
conditions of the test.  First PCsat was in a maximum eclipse phase, and
was only working in sunshine.  Second, the phases of PCsat and ISS in
their orbits were as-is, so joint periods when they wre both in line-of-
sight with each other were occuring randomly and often over areas where
PCsat was in the dark, or where there were no ground station observers.
Third the ISS PMS was not on the 145.825 frequency of operational all the
time.

TEST RESULTS:  (see http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/pcsat.html)

Even with these limitations, the test was a great success with the
following highlights:

1) On 12 October over the East coast of the USA, 6 stations relayed
successful packets between both spacecraft while they were within 260 to
600 miles of each other.  One station was a mobile.  Multiple successful
packets were captured as well into the internet linked ground station
system.

2) On 22 October over the USA, another 7 stations were successful and the
successful ranges between spacecraft ranged between 260 to 1880 miles.
Further highlights were:

   * New satellite-to-satellite distance record of 1880 miles.
   * DX record was made by a mobile operator while driving (in motion).
   * Successful sat-to-sat packet from a hiker with a handheld radio.
   * Successes despite lack of optimization of PCsat early in the pass.
   * PCsat successfuly reported its telemetry over the horizon via ISS.
   * Packets were received by the worldwide internet linked ground stns.
   * Generic spacecraft operation demonstrated by identical relay of
     the same source packet into both satelliite footprints.

3) These tests confirm the link-budget of omni-directional satellite-to-
satellite links using the installed ISS and PCsat antenna systems and
nominal 2 and 5 watt ERP systems.

4) This test demonstrated the viability of operating numerous 145.825
UI-Digipeating satellites in a loose constellation in the Amateur
Satellite Service to provide near continuous and remote area low data rate
communications from simple (mobile and handheld) stations.  Using generic
relay aliases and routing, all such satellites operate synergisitically
to support users on the ground transparently to their individual settings.

5) The test validated the worldwide system of simple fixed frequency,
omni-directional (no-track) internet linked ground stations combined with
the synergy of multiple spacecraft to provide near global connectivity
between the mobile/remote user and the global infrastructure.

CONCLUSION:  The test was a success.  It demonstrated that just a few, or
as many as 10 such satellite transponders can be accommodated on the
single 145.825 frequency with out problem while providing near continuous
global coverage to handheld, mobile, educational and other simple ground
stations in the Amateur Satellite Service.

ADDITIONAL REPORT DETAILS:

DUAL HOP GEOMETRY:  In general, ISS and PCsat were within range of each
other about 4 hours a day.  This ranges from 5400km grazing passes to
420km when PCsat is directly overhead ISS.  For reliable comms, this test
has validated about 2000km as the limit or about an hour a day.  But with
HAM activity in only about 10% of the Earth's surface, the probabiliy of
good geometry for a dual hop is rare.

But dual hop is not really a primary objective of a multisatellite
constellation over populated areas because all packets are heard by
numerous internet linked ground stations and eventually are distributed
worldwide anyway.  The advantage of dual hop paths are over the Oceans and
Poles, where remote travelers will be able to link remote packets two hops
to the nearest IGate.

ISS AVAILABILITY:  During this test, the ISS PMS system was occassionally
moved back to the primary 145.800 freqequency for voice and also the PMS
appears to have locked up twice for long periods as shown below.  This
PMS activity log was gathered with the help of Miles, WF1F.

ISS<==>PCSAT SUCCESS:

This was a pass of ISS and PCsat over USA with PCsat almost directlly
overhead of ISS over Canada.  To fit in 80 character Email, the first data
is truncated to Header andtruncated text and the second list is just the
CALLSIGN and the DATA part of the successful packets.  These times are
within 1 second of UTC.

At 19:56:15 or so (12 Oct), PCsat passed DIRECTLY 420 km over ISS and this
was about 100km NW of Natashquan, Quebec.  A minute 48 seconds earlier,
N4ZQ got the first successful packet and 40 seconds after the conjunction,
a series of successes lasted for another minute.  By that time the
separation between ISS and PCsat was about 960 km.

Although ISS and PCsat were in view over the entire USA, these succeses
occured after most of the USA was no longer in view.  The next pass was
also directly over USA, but ISS had switched back to voice on 145.800
and so no packet tests were possible.  But we did get to talk to Valery
and thank him for the test.  Here are the successful double hop packets.

the full text of those same successful packets.

Notice that packets went BOTH ways between the spacecraft.

One other station, KB1EAA inadvertantly got a Triple hop, but with a
ground station inbetween because he had a WIDE on the end of his path
(which we have recommended for better IGate success once the packet
reaches the ground).  But in this case, with ISS also having the WIDE
alias, it went back up via satellite!

[15:54:19] KB1EAA>APK002,W3ADO-1,SGATE,RS0ISS*/1::PCSAT    :HI{9

For this pass, PCsat was not commanded into optimum configuration
until about the middle of the pass but it was in proper mode and fully
functional with enough power by the time of the successful packets!

[20:13:59] KB1GVR>CQ,RS0ISS,W3ADO-1*/1:=4436.18N/06826.92W-> Ellsworth ME6

The first packet was a DX record for satellite-to-satellite packet of 1880
miles between spacecraft.  To see the geometries involved, see the maps on
the PCsat web page below.

    http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/pcsat.html

In the above dual-hop packets between ISS and PCsat, there are a few
packets of special interest that deserve comment:

The first packets were when ISS was out over the pacific with only the
west coast in view, thus there was little interference for the numerous
(7) easy DX successes (the first was over 1880 mi):  This packet decodes
as a packet from a mobile IN MOTION in Seattle, WA:

> [20:01:16] K7FZO-1>4W3YVV,RS0ISS,W3ADO-1*,SGATE,WIDE:'2^Al#1k/]"41}@arrl

The next packet below documents when the USNA Ground station set PCsat to
optimum power mode (after those initial packets).  The 7 previous
successful packets shows us that PCsat can support dual hop packets even
without command station support (placing it in best power mode).

> [20:05:42] COMAND-1*>WB4APR-3 <UA>prompt:OUTPUT was 11111111...

The next packet shows the Batterys almost fully charged at 16.5 volts
each!  But these are very weak NiCd's that are "soft" and near the end of
their life, so a high voltage under charge doesnt really mean things are
all that great... and the telemetry counter of #020 shows us it has only
been alive for 20 minutes even though it has been in the sun almost 40.

> [20:06:21] W3ADO-1*>BEACON,SGATE:T#020,165,165,067,219,213,00111111,0111,1

The next packet is another first, from a Handheld in the hands of a hiker
in the mountains of Washington State:

> [20:08:09] K7FZO-7>TWRWYS,W3ADO-1,RS0ISS*,WIDE3-3:'1Dol [/>

The next two packets are another first.  it is the first time a satellite
has reported its own telemetry and ID via another satellite.

> [20:08:25] W3ADO-1>BEACON,RS0ISS*:T#022,079,067,077,101,213,00111111,0101,1
> [20:08:40] W3ADO-1>ID,RS0ISS*:W3ADO-1/R XBAUD/G MAIL-1/B

The next packet shows that ISS is now configured to also digipeat its own
packets via another satellite or ground station with the alias of
SGate.  I was supposed to add SGATE as a UI-DIGI alias on PCsat so that
PCsat would do the same for ISS.  That is, it would relay the ISS beacons
when ISS was normally out of range of any other ground stations.
(The SGATE alias was not configured on PCsat for this pass).

> [20:08:52] RS0ISS*>CQ,SGATE:>ARISS - International Space Station

The next two packets show a single original packet picked up by both
spacecraft and then both spacecraft relay it successfully via the other.
This is the normal APRS generic routing method where the packet was
generically transmitted using the path of via WIDE,WIDE, and then each
satellite recognizes the alias of WIDE and then digipeats the packet while
substituting its callsign in place of the generic WIDE so that the actual
path taken is shown.  (This only works when PCsat is commanded to enable
its WIDE alias DURING the pass. THus it worked here, but don't plan on it,
because PCsat now forgets all settings every 100 minutes due to eclipses).

[20:09:51] WB4APR-3>APRS,RS0ISS,W3ADO-1*,ARISS/1:Lets try OPS NORMAL
[20:09:52] WB4APR-3>APRS,W3ADO-1,RS0ISS*,ARISS/1:Lets try OPS NORMAL

And the last packet was again excellent DX as both satellites passed
over the East coast and yielded a 1340 mi path between spacecraft.

> [20:13:59] KB1GVR>CQ,RS0ISS,W3ADO-1*/1:=4436.18N/06826.92W-> Ellsworth ME6

Again, the purpose of this test was to show the utility of a simple UI
digipeating TNC on orbit especially if we have multiple such TNCs and
satellites on the same frequency.  Remember, ANY satellite can do this if
it just has a TNC on 145.825.  That's all PCsat is, a TNC and a 555 timer
to reset it every now and then.  PCsats RESET problems are not related to
that design, but only to the loss of one solar panel on launch and
subsequent negative power budget during periods of eclipse.

We hope to see more satellite launches in the future with digipeating
TNC's to expand this comunications capability into a constellation of UI
digipeating satellites on 145.825 with one always in view of the most
remotest of travelers or portable operators.
