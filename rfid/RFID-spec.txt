APRS RFID SPEC version 1.13                           10 May 2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1.13 cleans up definitions using similar terms to APRStt
     changes +A-G+II/XY to +A-G+ss/XY (step-size)
1.12 changes to +A-G+II/XY and adds options to freetext
1.11 changes +AA-GG+III to +IIN

This Spec makes it possible to build an APRS HotSPot RFID reader 
for under $30 RFID and any old standard TNC/Radio.  This makes 
it possible for clubs to implement HotSpots at low initial cost 
and to begin looking for applications.  The result is that any
tag detected by the HotSpot causes an APRS packet to go out for
the callsign of the Tag holder showing his position, and his
beacon text or text associated with that HotSpot.  This spec may 
be expanded in the future, but for now it applies to low cost
RFID tags with these specs:

  EM4001 ISO based RFID IC
  125kHz Carrier 
  2kbps ASK Manchester encoding 
  32-bit unique ID 
  64-bit data stream [Header+ID+Data+Parity]

APRS RFID CONCEPT:  Anyone carrying a $3 RFID card in their 
right shoe can signal their presence at any APRS HotSpot 
stepping  on the clearly marked HotSpot or walking through
a HotZone.  This action will generate an APRS packet on local 
RF and into the global APRS system indicating that ham's 
presence at this site.  The packet may include additional 
information such as the local frequency in use at this HotSpot.

Typical applications will be at Ham clubhouses, EOC's, Ham 
stores Hamfests, Meetings, conventions, and of course, Dayton.

HARDWARE:  There are three pieces to the APRS RFID concept.

1) The $3 RFID cards purchased by hams to signal their call
2) The RFID HotSpot: Under $30 RFID reader, TNC, & Radio
3) The ASSOCIATOR software that ties it together and generates
   the on-air APRS position packet for that user at that
   location.  Only one ASSOCIATOR is needed for all local
   HotSpots.

RFID CALLSIGN CARDS: These $3 cards are standard credit card size
and are white and blank.  They have a unique 32 bit code number 
(expressed as 5 bytes or 10 hex characters).  With 32 bits there 
can be over 4 billion unique cards.  For ham radio, the users 
CALLSIGN and SSID is associated with each of his RFID cards. 
There are two schools of thought depending on your own use of 
your tags. Either make them all have your CALL-7 SSID to show
you were walking, or make them the same as your car CALL-9 so 
that when you arrive or leave a place, your CALL-9 goes with you 
and is not left at the HotSpot. It is imperative to associate 
one and only one callsign permanently with each card because 
that association will be impossbible to reliably change later 
thorought the entire APRS system. For multiple shoes, buy 
multiple $3 RFID cards. Write the callsign on the RFID card.

HOTSPOT CARD READER HARDWARE: The RFID reader is an under $30
reader module connected to a 5" to 24" coil of wire and its 
serial output connected to a TNC and Radio. The data is at 9600 
baud and is connected to the TNC TXD line.  Additional provision 
is needed for 5 volt power for the RFID reader and an optional
Beeper and/or LED can be added on the reader's TAG-READ 
output pin to beep/flash when a tag is detected.  The RFID 
module can even be installed inside the box of most TNC's (but 
then the wires to the coil must be short or taken into account 
during coil tune-up). The TNC operates in UNPROTO converse and 
sends the raw output of the RFID reader on a dedicated channel 
(for a multi-site system) or on the local APRS channel to he 
ASSOCIATOR.

For a specsheet on the reader see:
http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ID-12-Datasheet.pdf

But the spec sheet is confusing in two areas:  1) the RS232 
equivalent output is on pin 8 (labeled CMOS) and the ground on 
Pin 1 is left off their diagram!  Further, the pin spacing
is not the standard 0.1" and so I broke apart a high-quality
DIP socket and then put individual pin sockets on the pins
so that I did not bugger up the module during testing.  Later
modules, I just soldered to the pins.

For purchasing information see:
www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8709

RFID READER SERIAL OUTPUT:

The RAW output from the RFID reader is at 9600 baud and consists
of 16 bytes. The format is only sent once each time the card is 
within the few inches of the coil. A second read is only 
possible if the card is removed from the coil area and then 
brought back in range.  The format is:
 
  SddddddddddKKCLE 
 
  Where S is STX (02h) 
  where dddddddddd is the 5 byte tag# in 10 ASCII HEX characters 
  where KK is a HEX checksum 
  where CL is CR/LF
  where E is ETX (which is unfortunately 03h (^C))


HOTSPOT OUTPUT FORMAT:  The HotSpot TNC transmits this raw
format via the Radio usually on a special local RFID TAG-to-
ASSOCIATOR frequency.  This format is not of direct use to any 
existing APRS system except for the ASSOCIATOR where the 
tag number is associated wih a callsign and a position. Then it 
gets converted into the standard APRS format for distribution 
throughout the APRS RF and IS system.  The HotSpot TNC outputs 
any of these AX.25 formats depending on how the TNC was setup:

  SPOTID-SS>APRFID,path:SddddddddddKKCLE
  SPOTID-SS>APRFID,path:ESddddddddddKKCL
  SPOTID-SS>APRFID,path:ESddddddddddKKC
  SPOTID-SS>APRFID,path:SddddddddddKKCL
  SPOTID-SS>APRFID,path:SddddddddddKKC
  SPOTID-SS>APRFID,path:LESddddddddddKKC

  Where SPOTID-SS is the unique call of that HotSpot TNC
  Where APRFID is the special TOCALL for the EM4001 ISO tags
  Where Path gets the packet to the CALL-ASSOCIATOR or Igate
  Where SddddddddddKKCLE is the raw Tag info

The different versions above depend on how the TNC processes 
the ending CR, LF and ETX byte.  In normal UNPROOTO-CONVERSE
mode, the LF and ETX can wrap around and can become attached 
to the beginning of the next tag read.  The first (preferred) 
format can be forced, but takes detailed TNC set-up of many 
commands and we expect set-ups will make mistakes.  THus, the 
ASSOCIATOR needs to be able to recognize all of these 
possibilities or have to fight sysops forever until they get 
their TNC's set up right.

HOTSPOT TNC SETUP: The settings for most common TNC to be used 
at the HotSpot are listed here. These are the commands for 
the KPC-3 in pseudo english, but other TNC's have similar 
commands. 

  MYCALL FCCALL is the FCC callsign of the HotSpot TNC
  ABAUD 9600    sets serial port to match RFID reader port 
  BT ;SPOT-NAME*111111zDDMM.mmNHDDDMM.mmWA+A-G+ss/XY.SiteText...
  BEACON Evy 10 minutes 
  UNPROTO APRFID VIA WIDE1-1 (get to Igate) 
  COM $04       Changes command-mode from ^C to ^D 
  SENDPAC $03   Makes it send packet on $03 instead of CR
  CR OFF        Makes the TNC not include the $03 in the packet
  LFADD OFF     Makes sure the TNC does not add linefeeds
  
There is another command (I haven't found yet) that makes sure 
the TNC will start up in CONVERSE mode every time from a power 
up.  If you can find it, add that as well. 

HOTSPOT OBJECT NAME:  The format of the HotSpot beacon above is 
configured to convey all the important information that the
ASSOCIATOR needs to generate the user APRS OBJect packet.  First
of course, it contains the name of the hotspot in the 9 byte
OBJect Name field.  THe APRS spec allows both upper and lower
case to differentiate simillarly named objects (though many
systems -wrongly- ignore case).  The ASSOCIATOR should be case
sensitive.

HOTSPOT MAPLIST ORIGIN:  The +A-G+ss/XY field of the HotSpot
object tell the ASSOCIATOR where to build the on-map-list when 
placing RFID users at this HotSpot. The +/- A is an offset in 
hundredths of a minute of Latitude as to where the ORIGIN of the
on-map-list of calls will go and the +/- G is the offset in 
hundredths of minutes of Longitude.  

The +/- ss/XY field contains 
the ss latitude step-size (in thousandths of a minute) that tells 
the ASSOCIATOR what vertical spacing to put between the calls on 
the map.  The "X" byte tells the associator how many columns it
may use to list callsigns on the map.  The "Y" byte tells it 
how many rows of objects it can make in each column.  The number 
of calls in a column is actualy 3Y for a maximum of 27 high if 
Y is 9.  When the first column fills up the longitude is 
decremented by 10 times the amount of Latitude step-size (ss) 
and should also be divided by the COSINE of the latitude so that 
the spacing is not distorted at high latitudes.  In the Eastern 
Hemisphere, the longitude is incremented.

The offsets and step-size are chosen to give the best list 
display at a zoom level appropriate for the situation.  For one 
reader at a ham radio clubhouse, the list might be formed with a
step-size of .09 minutes latitude so the list can be easily viewed 
at an 8 or 16 mile local range scale.  Whereas for putting people 
in a room at Dayton, the step-size might be .002 minutes of 
latitude so that everyone fits in the room when viewed at the 
1/4 mile range scale.

HOTSPOT OBJECT AGE:  The standard timeout in APRS is 80 minutes.
In general a callsign ASSOCIATOR may use this 80 minute time out
as a means to re-use slots in the map list.


HOTSPOT SiteText:  The "SiteText..." field is variable 
length but users are encouraged to limit it to 8 bytes if 
possible so that it fits nicely on the thousands of D700 mobile 
screens.  This Freetext has TWO possible sources, the HotSPot or 
the User.  As indicated above, the HotSpot Beacon defines a 
default SiteText that is significant to its particular location, 
such as the monitoring frequency in that area. It begins with
a "." separator to indicate it is from the HotSpot.  Thus 
everyone stepping on that HotSpot will get that SiteText (if 
they have not otherwise pecified one themselves).  If the
HotSpot wants to force its text on the users default, then
the separator is a "=" and will appear on user packets as
"=SiteText"

USER UserText:  But a User can also override this SiteText and 
force his own UserText to be associated with his RFID tag.  He 
specifies that UserText as part of his ASSOCIATION MESSAGE 
(see below).  If he enters no UserText or UserText with a SPACE
separator his UserText is only used if the HotSpot does not 
have one.  But if he uses an "+" separator (or no separator so
he can get oe more byte onto an HT or mobile display), then he 
wants his UserText to override the default ".SiteText" of the 
HotSpot.  If he wants to insist that his UserText be used at 
all times, then he uses a "!" when associating his text.

Again, a useful applicaiton is to associate one's own personal 
calling frequency with his tag.  His own UserText can be set to
override the HotSpot ".SiteText".

It is recommended that important information be contained only 
in the first 8 bytes of this free text so that it can display 
well on all D700 mobile radios.  A very common application of 
this field will be the frequency in use in the area of the 
HotSpot...  Such as 147.075 MHz at my Lab.

FREETEXT SUMMMARY:
 HotSpot .SiteText... is used if no other text specified
 User    +UserText... is used if user specified
 User    UserText.... same as above, but allows one more char
 HotSpot =SiteText... is used over either of the above
 User    !UserText... is used over all of the above


ASSOCIATOR FUNCTIONS AND OUTPUTS:

The ASSOCIATOR has three functional responsibilities:

 - Watching for user callsign-to-RFID  registration messages
 - Collecting the locations of HotSpots object beacons
 - collecting the HotSpot objects map-list origins
 - watching for any raw APRS RFID tag number packets
 - Confirming checksum (otherwise ignoring the packet)
 - Associating good tag numbers with a callsign
 - Building map-lists at those origins using offset & increment 
 - Transmitting the assembled position packet for the tag user


CALLSIGN ASSOCIATOR USER PACKET:

The callsign ASSOCIATOR receives the above RIFID from a given 
SPOT-NAME and matches it to a callsign and generates the 
following standard APRS position packet for the local RF 
network: 

Header: CALL-SS>APRFID,WIDE2-2: 
Packet: !DDMM.mmNRDDDMM.mmWAdddddddddd@SPOT-NAME.Freetext !DAO! 

 Where CALL-SS is the callsign associated with the tag number 
 Where the APRS SYMBOL is "RA". 
 Where !DDMM.mmNRDDDMM.mmWA is the standard positon format 
 Where the tag number is the first 10 bytes of position comment
 where @SPOT-NAME is the name of the HotSpot where detected
 Where .Freetext is either the SiteText or UserText 

Example HotSpot names are "HARAarena", "Northhall", "ARRLbooth", 
"KENWOOD", or " Yaesu ", etc.  Example SiteText for a clubhouse
might include a frequency 147.105 or even for Dayton, each 
HotSpot can have a separate call frequency so that you can call
someone standing there.

The result of the specific above on-air format is that it will 
show up well on D7, D700 and VX8R radio front panels.  Here are 
some examples 

On a D7:                    Or on a D700 as:
+------------+              +------------+
| WB4APR-7   |              | WB4APR-7   |
| 1234567890 |              | 1234567890 |
| @HARAarena |              | @HARAarena |
+------------+              | .SiteText  |
                            +------------+
If SiteText was a freq:
+------------+              Or on a VX-8R:
| WB4APR-7   |              +----------------------+
| 1234567890 |              | WB4APR-7             |
| @HARAarena |              | 1234567890@HARAarena |
| =147.555   |              | =147.555 or more txt |
+------------+              +----------------------+

The individual position of each user triggering the RFID 
HotSpot is built by incrementing or decrementing the tiny 
step-size of Latitude from the map-list-origin associated 
with that RFID HotSpot.  

Notice that the above format includes the higher resolution 
!DAO! format so that the list of calls in a given room can 
actually be placed in a list without overlap when viewed at 
a reasonable map scale for that application. This works with 
all clients, since the pseudo maplist is compiled at the
ASSOCIATOR for consistent viewing at all clients.  Viewers 
just zoom in close enough and the list will appear.

HIGH RESOLUTION !DAO! HUMAN READABLE FORMAT:  For this 
application the !DAO! Human readable format will be used for 
the user calls placed on the map in the maplist. Using simply 
!W10! for example means to use WGS-84 datum and the latitude 
thousandths digit for this user is "1" in latitude and "0" in 
longitude.  The next user up (about 6 feet) in the list would 
have !W20! and so forth.


CALLSIGN ASSOCIATION: The users CALLSIGN and SSID is associated 
with each of his RFID tags. There are two schools of thought 
depending on your own use of your tags. Either make them all have 
your CALL-7 SSID to show you were walking, or make them the same 
as your car CALL-9 so that when you arrive or leave a place, your 
CALL-9 goes with you and is not left at the HotSpot. It is 
imperative to associate one and only one callsign permanently 
with each card because that association will be impossbible to 
reliably change later thorought the entire APRS system. For 
multiple shoes, buy multiple $3 RFID cards. Write the callsign 
on each RFID card.  Two shoes means you can carry two calls
and select which one is read by how you step. 

The ASSOCIATOR must accumulate a file of all tag numbers and 
associated calls.  There are any number of ways to do this.
The initial RFID number to callsign association can be made 
at the local ASSOCIATOR or point-of-sale of the RFID card 
-OR- anywhere else that a keyboard or keypad is attached.  
But the easiest method is for the user himself to transmit it 
into the APRS system by a special message.  

The actual method used does not matter, since once even a local
association is made, the resulting on-air packet will contain
the association.  From that, ALL systems locally or globally 
can collect these associations from the APRS-IS. Also clubs 
with large numbers of card holders can submit RFID files to 
pre-load the APRS-IS system.  Further a central server on the
APRS-IS can be written as a clearing house to maintain the
global association file and make ti available on the web for
download.

CALLSIGN ASSOCIATION MESSAGE:  The standard MESSAGE format for 
a user to send to register his tag number and callsign 
association is:

 From:  The callsign to be associated
 TO:    RFID
 MSG:   ddddddddddkk+UserText  (overrides HotSpot default text)
 OR:    ddddddddddkk!UserText  (overrides HotSpot pri text)

The ASSOCIATOR looks for these messages and adds them to the
data base.  This way, anyone with any APRS system (mobile or 
HT) can manually send a message to join the system.  From then 
on, the association is made... *and should never be changed!*.
It cannot be changed because the association will propagate 
throughtout APRSdom and any attempts to change it will result
in orphaned associaitns and the potential for conflict and
confusion.
