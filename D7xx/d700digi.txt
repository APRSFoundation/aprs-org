DIGIPEATING SETTINGS FOR THE D-700                      21 oct 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Revised 21 Oct 2014 to clarify permanent digipeating
*** Revised 14 April 2005 for the New n-N Paradigm
*** Revised 31 May 2006   for TEMPn-N digipeating

Although the D-700 supports digipeating, care must be taken in how
it is set up and used.  First, we do not, in general, want mobile
digipeaters running around on a routine basis multiplying the
number of packets.  Second, some of the settings have the same name
but work differently from the same settings in other digipeaters,
for example the KPC-3+.  So please heed the following recommendations.

The D700 is confusing, because it allows you to use the front panel
to set DIGI ON or OFF and to make entries in the UIDIGI Alias list,
but you cannot change the UIFLOOD or UITRACE parameters that support
WIDEn-N digipeating from the front panel and require a serial cable
and PC to change them.

FRONT PANEL MENU CONTROLS:

DIGIpeat ON:  This command only affects digipeating via your callsign.
This should remain on.  If someone wants to go to the trouble to
digipeat via your mobiile when he can hit nothign else, then by all
means we want to suppor him.

UIDIGI none:  Defaults to UIDIGI RELAY,WIDE.  These are obsolete 
because they have no dupe-elimination mechanism under 3 hops and were 
the cause of tremendous dupes on the APRS system. If you are parked 
on a hill and do need to TEMPORARILY support digipeating of special
event mobiles, the set UIDIGI WIDE1-1.  If mobiles will be using
other initial hops, and you do not have a PC to properly activate 
UITRACE WIDE, then you can temporarily add other aliases for this 
event vian the MENU by adding WIDE1-1, WIDE2-2, WIDE2-1, and WIDE3-2 
etc to the UIDIGI MENU. Thus can temporarily support first-hop 
digipeating but the packets will die after this first hop.  These 
digipeats will be callsign substituted after your transmission and 
will go no farther.

UIFLOOD TEMP:  This setting should be set permanently in all D700
radios via the serial port to support backup TEMPn-N DIGIPEATING.
This makes it easy to use a D700 mobile as a multi-hop digipeater 
on an immediate basis.  This means that we encourage all
D700 mobiles to permanently set their UITRACE parameter to TEMP.
That is, "UITRACE TEMP" is the command you provide at the command
prompt on the serial port to enable the D700 to always digipeat any
TEMPn-N packets.  THis makes them instantly useable at any time
by anyone with the path TEMPn-N.  Sort of an invisible backup
network ready to be used at any time a D700 is in range.
Leave this set permanently so that it is there if needed.


SETTING THE D700 as a FULL FUNCTION DIGIPEATER VIA THE SERIAL PORT:

If you want to set the D700 to act as a full function digipeater
then use the following settings.  Then saving that configuration 
in a PM so that it can be activated and de-activated in te field 
by chaing PM's.  WIthout the PM's you must use your serial port 
and a PC to disable these settings if you ever take this D700 mobile 
again.  So use these commands with caution and full intent of 
setting up a permanent digi only.

AUTO-PM-SAVE OFF:  If you save settings in a PM, be sure to find the
AUTO-PM-SAVE command and be sure it is OFF.  It defaults to ON and
though this is confusing, it will cause your desreid PM savings to 
be overwritten every time you turn the radio off. YOU DONT want that!

UIFLOOD SS,ID:  This command has a bug and should NEVER be used 
with NOID.  Fortunately with ID on, it works identical to the KPC-3+ 
digipeaters and will support the SSn-N system.  Just set 
"UIFLOOD SS,30,ID" to support SSn-N digipeating for your State or 
Section.  Notice this receommendaton TO use ID and to never use NOID 
is exactly opposite of the recommendations that used to be in place 
before the New-N-Paradigm prior to 2004.  So remember, UIFLOOD should 
have ID in the D700.

UITRACE WIDE:  Under the new n-N paradigm, WIDEn-N is now supported in
the UITRACE parameter so that all WIDEn-N paths are traceable.
Set "UITRACE WIDE"

For more information on the New n-N Paradigm, see the web page:
http://aprs.org/fix14439.html

But PLEASE Disable UIFLOOD SS and return UITRACE from WIDE back to TEMP
when this D700 is not being used explicitly as a fixed digi.  Otherwise 
it will add QRM to the network


FIELD DAY and OTHER SPECIAL EVENT OPERATIONS WITH TEMPn-N:

The permanent use of "UITRACE TEMP" to support TEMPn-N digipeating
not only gives us an instant temporary alternate network for FIeld
Day on 145.01 for that day, but also then gives us a permanent
shadow network all the rest of the time on 144.39 that anyone
can use as a first hop if they cannot get out with WIDE1-1 or
WIDEn-N.

DEBUGGING the UIFLOOD-ID PARAMETER:  For example, if you are receiving 
a local station sporadically with a variety of -13, -14, -15 SSID's 
then there is a D700 somewhere with UIFLOOD set with NOID enabled.  Find
it and fix it to ID, or better is to disable UIFLOOD completely and
set "UITRACE TEMP" to support only TEMPn-N digipeats.

WARNING:  The UIFLOOD and UITRACE parameters can only be set with
an attached PC.  And once set, the radio will remember it always.
The only way to turn it back off is with the PC again.  So be
very careful and very intentional when messing with these parameters
in the D700, or set UITRACE TEMP,30 and dont worry ever again.
