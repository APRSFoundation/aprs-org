<B>2010 Jamboree is Over!</B> Its now time to prepare for 2013 at the new location
in South Eastern West Virginia.  
<A HREF="http://www.newriverwv.com/images/The_Summit_100_Year_Vision.jpg"><B>See map.</B></A>
and see our new planning page for
<A HREF="aprs-jamboree-2013.html"><B>2013</B></A>.

<P>

<B>APRS Communications Planning for Jamboree 2010!</B>
<BR><B>Bring your APRS HT, or, if you don't have one, 
<i>bring any HT with DTMF memory!</i>.  It can be tracked too!</B>

<P>
Not only can APRS help you find each other and track
your troops movements for display back home, but also your APRS HT can be used
for sending back messages and email for scouts to show the value of ham radio
in the field.  APRS is ideal for field use since it helps everyone maintain
tactical situational awareness locally while also providing global connectivity
for messaging.  You don't even need to bother with a GPS.  Just manually enter
your position using the GRIDDED map 
that everyone at Jamboree will have shown below.  Just change the last 2 digits
in your lat/long as you move about camp and everyone will see you.

<P>
You can also use ANY HT with a DTMF keypad to enter your position using those 
same four digits.

<P>
<B>APRS Coverage at Jamboree 2010:</B>
<P>
The APRS network can provide coverage not only in your travels across country
to and from Jamboree, but also down to your campsite.
Simply click on this 

<A HREF="http://aprs.fi/?lat=38.141&amp;lng=-77.337&amp;z=10&amp;mt=k&amp;timerange=16400"><B>Last 3 hours Live Jamboree APRS map</B></A>
to see all APRS activity in and around the Jamboree at AP Hill.  
The existing coverage of permanent digipeaters is shown to the right and was 
augmented by on-site digipeaters to provide coverage to HT's everywhere.  
As of April 2010, there was also a new IGate/digi in Fredricksburg 
closer to AP hill.  
See <A HREF="http://aprs.fi/heard/NI4VA-5"><B>this plot of NI4VA-5 digi</B></A> on the
NW corner of the AP hill site.
<BR>

<P> 
Stephen Shearer, WB3LGC and Ed Dudley put together this 
<A HREF="aprstt/jamboree-aprs-folks.txt"><B>list</B></A> of potential APRS
volunteers to help make this happen.  See this Google Earth View of the
<A HREF="aprstt/k2bsa-layout-ants.JPG"><B>K2BSA location</B></A> and 
a <A HREF="aprstt/k2bsa-tent.JPG"><B> view of the K2BSA tent</B></A>.

<P>
<B>Use your DTMF HT for APRS at Jamboree 2010!</B>  We hope that everyone with an HT can 
participate in APRS, not just those with the special APRS hardware, because
there will be an APRStt (Touchtone) gateway there that lets these users 
also send their position and status into the APRS system at the event.
APRStt is just a gateway centrally located and running <B>APRSspeak</B>
software on a laptop with two radios as shown to the
right.  It acts as a gateway between the DTMF users on 146.58 and the rest
of the APRS users on the APRS channel (144.39).  It receives DTMF data and
responds with Voice Reports from APRS.  When the new <B>APRSspeak</B> software is
ready for release, you can get it <A HREF="http://www.APRSspeak.com"><B>here</B></A>. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/APRStt-dwg2.GIF" align=right>

<B>SENDING YOUR POSITION BY DTMF:</B> To send your position first you have to
program a DTMF memory in your HT with your DTMF text equivalent callsign using the 
format of <B><i>AxxxxxxxxxxVK#</i></B> using the 
<A HREF="aprstt/aprstt-user.txt"><B>two-key method</B></A>.  
David, K3PO wrote a simple 
<A HREF="http://www.retroscape.com/aprstt/"><B>Callsign Translator</B></A>
to help you enter your call into your DTMF memory.

 Once that is done
one time, then all you have to do to report your position is 3 steps:
<P>
<LI> Press PTT
<LI> Key in <i><B>Bxxyy*</B></i> where the <B>xx</B> and <B>yy</B> are the two digit
grid numbers 
<LI> with <B>xx</B> across the top and <B>yy</B> down the side.
<LI> Next send your callsign from DTMF memory
<LI> Release PTT
<P>

<!--
<B>SUBCAMP METHOD:</B> Another way to report your position is by subcamp.  Each time you
return to your subcamp location, you can send that position report using the <B>B0ss*</B>
format.  In this format, <B>"ss"</B> is your subcamp number.  APRStt will convert that to
a position in the center of your subcamp.
<P>
//-->

<B>FREQUENCY:</B> You can also add text to your position.  Probably the most valuable
information on your position is to show what voice frequency you are monitoring.
To transmit your Frequency, just use the format <B><i>CFFFFFF*</i></B> 
which is the frequency in KHz, again, followed by your callsign from memory.
<P>

<P>

The above map above is the official Jamboree map that everyone at the Jamboree with
always have with them.  To make it useful for APRS, we have replaced the A-Z latitude 
grid on the left hand edge with numbers 42 through 66 so
that we can use keypad digits instead of numbers.  Anyone with this map can
report their position using the <B>xx/yy</B> grid and will show on all APRS maps
and the global APRS system.  Notice all grid numbers will be between 1000 and 3770.
<P>

If you look carefully, you can see an APRStt user W3XYZ-12 in the yellow ACTION CENTER-3.
All APRStt users will show with a -12 SSID on their callsign and will have the APRStt
keypad symbol so that they can be distinguished from normal APRS users who will also show 
on the same map.
<P>
<B>Precise Position Reporting with DTMF:</B>  Of course, if you have a GPS, then

you know your position to better accuracy.  You can report that better position also
using your DTMF HT by using the format of <B>B3xxxyyy*</B> where xxx and yyy are 
the minutes of latitude and longitude in 38 deg 0Y.YYN and 77 deg ?X.XXW.
<P>

<P>

<B>Applications of APRS at Jamboree:</B> Remember, APRS is just another tool
in the ham radio operators tool bag.  It is not an end in itself.  
So how APRS will be used at Jamboree
will depend on the amateur radio operators that will be there and are part
of the organization.  We are only providing the tool.  Think outside the
box how we can use position reporting <B>or </B> any othere numeric data
from HT's during jamboree.
<P>

<B>Best Location?</B> Bobby Lacey KF4GTA*contesting.com h as provided a 
<A HREF="http://bit.ly/2RFlfL"><B>Google Terrain map</B></A> that shows the Jamboree site
has no real high points, but does have several shallow valleys.  Looking at the Terrain,
my guess would be the best spot for a centeral digipeater, APRStt or voice repeater would
be in the area of action center B becuause it has valleys on both sides in the directinos
of the other activity areas so would have less loss through the trees... maybe.

<B>APRStt BACKGROUND:</B>
<P>

We first demonstrated the APRStt concept back in 2001 at Dayton using hardware 
DTMF decoders and a parallel port voice synthesizer, It was again demonstrated
in 2009 by Rick Ruhl <B>W4PC</B>.  But now finally in 2010, we have a working
version demonstrated at Dayton by KA2UPW, Doug that is called APRSspeak.  It
runs on a PC with nothing but a pair of radios, 
and this establishes a local APRStt zone 
where any nearby HT that ID's itself by DTMF memory will be converted to APRS at that location.
or they can enter their position data too.
<P>


<B>THINKING OUTSIDE THE APRS <I>TRACKING</I> BOX:</B>
<P>
Everyone has heard me say over and over that APRS is not a tracking system, 
but is a common local/global information exchange and distribution system 
for tactical and real time data of
immediate communincations support value to users.  To appreciate the potential 
of APRStt, you have got to forget 
about APRS as a tracking system, and think about what kinds of simple digital 
data can
be exchanged in support of an event or local activity.  Here are several DATA items 
that can easily be sent by DTMF::
<P>
<LI> The user's Voice Monitoring Frequency
<LI> The user's map Grid coordinates
<LI> Event Times, Scores, Unit ID's, item counts, speeds, distances, etc
<LI> Position (yes, and even position)
<P>

<B>VOICED INFORMATION:</B>  Even without using DTMF or inputing any data, 
anyone can tune into the APRStt (or APRSspeak) voice channel
and hear unsolicited information of local significance.  Positions are reported
as a direction and range from a reference point (usually the APRStt engine).  For
example <I>"WB4APR is 4.5 miles northeast"</i>.  Of course APRStt users can change
the reference point by DTMF command such as <I>"from the repeater"</i> 
or <i>"from downtown"</i> 
or <i>"from FINISH",</i> etc.
For example, here are some of the unsolicited reports that were implemented in APRStt1.0
back in 2001:
<P>
<LI> APRStt would speak the frequency of any station that changed the freq in his packet
<LI> APRStt would speak the call and location of any new callsign that was heard
<LI> APRStt would speak the local FREQUENCY object for travlers as they came into town
<LI> APRStt would speak the movements of many special stations.
<UL> A) Any TH-D7 using the  TRIANGLE ICON
<BR> B) Any D700 or any other APRS mobile using the "/n" ICON
<BR> C) Any one station commanded by the APRStt operator (or DTMF user)
</UL>
<P>


</UL>
<i>For example, the callsign <B>WB4APR</B> in DTMF is spelled as 
<B>A9A2B42A7A7C71#</B></i>. 
That one callsign-burst when received by the APRStt receiver and 
forwarded into the APRS
system yields all of the following important information:
<P>
<LI> My CALL, DATE and TIME are captured
<LI> My POSITION is plotted with a special APRStt icon within a vicinity list of that receiver
<LI> The local event FREQUENCY (and tone/shift) might be included so I can be contacted
<LI> His EchoLink/ILRP number (or reverse patch number) might be included so I can be called 
<LI> I can include a few bytes of text message if I want
<P>

<B>APRStt VOICE RESPONSE:</B> The feedback from APRStt to DTMF users is all by
synthesized voice.  The APRStt acknowledges a properly decoded DTMF checkin with 
"Welcome CCCC".   APRS messages to a DTMF user are spoken.  APRS positions when
spoken over APRStt are always spoken as a DIRECTION and DISTANCE from a local
REFERENCE.  By defualt, the local reference is the location of the APRStt
engine itself, but this reference can be changed by the DTMF user to any other
APRS location in the system. DIRECTION is spoken as the 16 cardinal points of
the compass as in North, NorthNortheast, Northeast, EastNorthEast, East, etc.
This verbal positioning lets <I> everyone </i> in the club or at an event 
participate in the exchange of APRS data, not just those with the APRS radios.
Even the old codger that shows up with his venerable 20 year old HT can participate!
<P>


<P>

<IMG SRC="aprstt/tt-gate.jpg" align=right>

<B> APRStt IS SIMPLE!</B> All you need is two radios and a laptop running the 
APRStt software (APRSspeak) and then it serves as the gateway between the DTMF users and the
rest of the APRS system as shown to the right.  
It lets 100% of ham radio users "check-in"
on APRS to facilitate end-to-end contact between operators, not just
the 5% that show up with APRS walkie-talkies.
<P>

<B>APRStt responds!</B> On hearing the DTMF callsign and sending out the position 
and frequency packet on the APRS channel, the more advanced APRStt implementations
will respond by voice with 
<B><i>"Welcome W3XYZ!"</B></i> as confirmation.  This is really no different than
what mobiles do now "WB4APR LIstening", except that using the DTMF method is
machine readable and allows this <i>presence</i> to the global ham radio community
via APRS instead of falling on deaf ears.
<P>

<B>APRStt two-way:</B> Now then, these same more sophisticated 
APRStt systems can also watch the APRS system for any messages addressed to you.
Hearing any, they will SPEAK them back to you on the voice channel!
The specialized full two-way <B>APRStt Engine</B> can be as simple as a laptop 
at any repeater site or located in the valley at a home station as shown below.  

<P>

<B>APRStt</B> is the gateway for DTMF voice users to report themselves to the
global APRS community of users.
It enables all non-APRS HT's and Mobile radios to be located and this information is
fundamental to facilitating ham radio communications.  See some examples:

<P>
<LI> Use DTMF to "check in" as noted above
<LI> A check-in indicates the date and time of your immediate availablity
<LI> A check-in puts you on the local/ national or global map
<LI> A check-in also identifies your voice frequency to everyone
<LI> Voice response informs the APRStt user of anything he needs to know
<LI> APRStt can speak incoming messages to APRStt users
<LI> APRStt allows DTMF origination of messages, emails or anything else in APRS
<LI> APRStt can speak the position ("LEAD is 3.5 miles NW of FINISH") of special trackers
<LI> APRStt can speak the bearing and range to any object or even satellites that come into view...
<LI> Users can QUERY APRStt with DTMF about ANYTHING on the air in APRS...
<LI> APRS/APRStt can even tie into the global Echooink system for global voice comms knowing only a callsign!
