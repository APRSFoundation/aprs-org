<B>This page addresses all issues related to the APRS Network.</B>
<P>
<LI>First of all <A HREF="D7xx/d700-faq.txt"><B>FIX your D700 settings</B></A>. 
and operate APRS mobile properly.
(<A HREF="D7xx/d710-setup.txt"><B>or the D710</B></A>).
<LI><B>Consider using DIGI Location instead of call:</B> Using the name WASHDC instead of W3XYZ for example to help visitors <i><b>see</B></i> the network.
<P>

<B>Executive Summary:</B> If your local APRS channel is not silent say 70% of the time,
then it is unreliable for realistic commmunications from most users due to collisions.
This page tells you how most areas are limiting hops to 2 hops or less.  Some busy
areas even limit digipeater response to 1 hop where population density is high and there
is an IGate in range of all digipeaters.
See <A HREF="fixingLA.html"><B>how to handle high density areas</B></A>.
<P>


<IMG SRC="D7xx/Rptr7-105x.JPG" align=right height=80 width=150>
<B>MORE MOBILE INFO:</B> Since 2004, the New-N Paradigm has included the distribution
of local info objects from digipeaters.  In 2009, this was increased to allow up to
3 such beacons from each digi to provide local-direct INFO beacons of local traveler 
info to mobile user radio displays as that shown to the right and below.  
Earlier, only the BText was available for these
beacons, but now we recommend using two more of the LTEXTS in the digis, for two more
important assets. Typically these are the local recommended travelers repeater and
possibly OPEN EchoLink or IRLP nodes.
See the <A HREF="localinfo.html"><B>localinfo</B></A> web page.
<P>

The APRS network is ideal for serving local relevant information
to mobile operators, travelers and visitors.  This includes not just the
frequencies of the repeater, IRLP or EchoLink nodes but also these frequency
objects should contain local NET times or meetings in progress, etc as shown here.
<P>

Notice how the IRLP and ECHOLINK nodes identify not only their node numbers and
callsigns, but also their <B>Tone and Range</B>... 
By pressing the OK button to see the POSIT screen, you can see that the Echolink
node is 17.1 miles to the Southwest.

<P>


<B>FIX YOUR ANTENNA FIRST:</B>  If you are seeing good "S" meter signals on
APRS but not decoding every packet, then you are hearing collisions from
two or more local digi's.  The APRS network is a contention based system
and so the best base-station antenna is often not a high omni.  It
is one that is placed such that it 
hears all local digis but with at least a 10 dB different signal between
them.  This assures that one will always win in a collision, 
and you wont miss any packets.  <A HREF="txt/antennas.txt"><B>read about APRS antennas</B></A>.
<P>
<B>Add a DIGI to your club's 2M Repeater Antenna:</B>  N3PX reports it is trivial to 
add a digipeater to an existing 147 or high-146 repeater to share existing antennas
and hardline using an extra duplexer. 
<A HREF="txt/digiduplexing.pdf"><B>See how</B></A>.

<P>
<B>The New-N Paradigm</B> was an initiative to vastly improve the APRS network beginning in about 2004. . 
Each of these improvements 
made a small contribution, but the overall impact when all of them were implemented and, in turn,
passed along in educating the user, resulted in factors of 2 to 5 improvement in overall APRS local
reliability!  If your area has not done this, then get on the air and motivate someone.

<B>Tragedy of the Commons:</B> . APRS suffers the classic fate of all limited resources
(as well documented since the 1830's 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">See Tragedy</A>).  
Whenever there is a balance between individual interests and
the common good, human nature guarantees the overloading and ultimate
demise of the common resource.  In this case, APRS throughput. . This is easy to 
understand since the benefit of adding one more packet to the network always immediately
benefits the SENDER, but the negative "cost" is spread over everyone else, and NOT the sender. .
There is no natural solution, other than the establishment of "Golden Rules" to
live by for all concerned.

<P>

<P>
<B>The APRS Golden Rule - The New-N Paradigm:</B>
<P>
By 2002, the APRS network in the USA was an inefficient conglomeration of legacy
systems that were still evolving.
<A HREF="digi-overlays.html"><B>see 2002 summary</B></A>.
. The New-N Paradigm began in Nov 2004 to streamline APRS for much
better efficiency and much simpler settings for users. . The result has been exciting improvements
everywhere it has been implemented. . 
The APRS network evolved over 13 years and by Nov 2004, it was time to abandon 
the obsolete settings causing
tremendous <A HREF="newN/relaypaths.txt"><B> RELAY-DUPE problems </B></A> in the USA. . The
<A HREF="newN/relayFIX.txt"><B> fix</B></A> was easy, all we needed were a few changed
remote-sysop parameters at the digipeaters without even a trip to the site.  
<B>UPDATE 2009:</B>  For what its worth, APRS is still growing with FINDU reporting 
60k user hits a day and a 30% growth per year and APRS.FI reporting 16k user hits
and 200% growth.  OpenAPRS is seeing comparable growth.
<P>

<B>Use WIDEn-N where N is appropriate for your area.</B>  
We called this initiative
the <i>New-N Paradigm</i>. . The changes simply boil 
down to one universal path recommendation for all users. . <B>Use WIDEn-N everywhere</B>
and N should be 2 in most major APRS areas of the country
shown below and 3 only in flat rural desolate areas. .  
That's about all there is to it. . But read on...

<U><B>FIXING THE 144.39 NETWORK:</U></B>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">
The New-N Paradigm not only changes some DIGIpeater parameters but also stresses
USER EDUCATION that a local 1200 baud APRS network capacity is greatly reduced
by each additional digipeater used. .  The area covered goes up, but the capacity is
reduced by half. .  Typical areas where people use 2 hops with four or more
digis, can only support about 60 to 100 or so users in its RF domain. .  Conversly, if no
digipeaters were used and eveyone could hear each other direct, APRS could theoreticlly
 support about 360 users on a simplex channel direct (with time slotting). . 
But because of many people using too many hops and bad paths that cause too many dupes
for surrounding areas, some areas  of the country are totally saturated 
with 10 times the amount of attempted 
packets with only the strongest and most abusive getting through. .  Net reliability is 
miserable for those locals whose packets cannot even get into the local digi due to 
out of area congestion. . This is self defeating.  There are many things wrong:
<P>
<LI>Lack of user understanding of fundamentals and severe limitations of such a small channel
<LI>Too many legacy path options due to obsolete paths making it hard to educate users
<LI>Too many collisions and lost packets due to too many Hops and too many duplicate packets

<B><u>FIX #1:  Phase out RELAY and WIDE Paths (also eliminate TRACE, TRACEn-N):</u></B>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
The single biggest improvement in the USA was simply getting users 
to stop using the obsolete RELAY and WIDE paths.  <A HREF="newN/relaypaths.txt"><B>(see why)</B></A>. .
The obsolete RELAY and WIDE paths generated multiple dupes in the KPC-3 and PacComm  and some other 
implementations because there is no dupe elimination for dupes heard from other digis. .  
These obsolete paths generated 3 to 5 times more load on the system than the comparable 
WIDEn-N path which has perfect dupe elimination algorithms.  
The fix was easy.  Use WIDE1-1 in place of RELAY. 
<A HREF="newN/relayFIX.txt"><B>(see The RELAY fix!)</B></A> and WIDEn-N in place of WIDE.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=4>
<B><u>FIX #2:  Make WIDEn-N Traceable:</u></B>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
The original WIDEn-N system was not traceable, making it impossible to do any network assessment
or management. .  The New-N Paradigm made WIDEn-N <B> traceable!</B>. .
(By eliminating TRACEn-N, Sysops can now move WIDEn-N support from the UIFLOOD parameter 
to the UITRACE parameter.)
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=4>
<B><u>FIX #3:  Use WIDEn-N everywhere. The New n-N Paradigm Solution:</u></B>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
WIDEn-N is the most efficient APRS path, but it is vulnerable to out-of area QRM from
user settings of large values of N. .  Fortunately, under the New n-N Paradigm, 
existing digis now trap large-N abuse  and greatly simplify user recommendations 
to simply one WIDEn-N path. .  The New n-N Paradigm simplifies the APRS network to  
a few distinct digipeater types:
<LI>WIDEn-N ..- The basis of the New n-N Paradigm.  They also support SSn-N for state nets (<B>S</B> overlay).
<LI>WIDE1-1 ...- Fill-In digis (where required only).  Set these fill-in digis MYALIAS to WIDE1-1.
<LI>One-Hop .. - These digis force big-N packets to 1 hop in extreme density areas. (LA or Dayton for example)
<LI>PacComm . - These old "T" digi ROMS can still be used locally for up to WIDE2-2 support (with <B>P</B> overlay)
<P>

<!-- COMMENTED OUT
<B>TWO APPROACHES TO LARGE-N,  CUTOFF, and TRAP-OUT:</B> There are two approaches 
to the same solution depending on whether your area is suffering badly from out of
area QRM and needs an immediate fix for QRM (CUT-OFF approach), or whether a more 
phased in-approach is used (TRAP-OUT). . .  
<LI>CUT-OFF turns off WIDEn-N and only adds back in what is desired, 
    (ie, WIDE1-1,2-2,2-1,3-3).  This was the LA solution...
<LI>TRAP-OUT moves WIDEn-N to UITRACE but begins to trap out
large N's at the source (Trap 4-4,5-5,6-6,7-7).
<P>
We have prepared a simple summary table to show how there is an
optimum digipeater setting for any given <i>user density </i> and then a digipeater settings table
to help you decide what kind of digipeater system you need for your area. . Later on will be the
detail TNC settings.

<B><U>Fix #4: THE NEW STATE SSn-N PATH FOR STATE/SECTIONS or REGIONS:</U> </B>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>

<B>The New n-N Paradigm</B> simplified to a traceable WIDEn-N as the most efficient APRS
path. .  This works well for small values of N in high density areas. .  But sometimes
fringe stations in the corner of a region, may need to participate in a region-wide net
and need more hops, but do not want to QRM adjacent 2 or 3 neighboring regions.
For this reason, the New-N Paradigm also includes the SSn-N system. . SSn-N solves 
this problem for each Region, State, Country or ARRL section.  In the USA we call them
States or ARRL Sections, in Europe, the regions are based on a combination of 
two iso-standards. ISO  3166-1 country code und ISO 3166-2 subdivision code.

<P>
With WIDEn-N support moved to the UITRACE parameter, this left the UIFLOOD process
available to support SSn-N, where larger values of N's can be tolerated and can get to the 
far reaches of a region, but not QRM other regions or users in other directions. . 
For example, a user in central Maryland can hit everyone in the region with WIDE3-3. . 
But those users in the panhandle and south, need maybe 6 hops to participate in the region wide
net. . Using the SSn-N path of MD6-6 will hit all the way to the ends of the region (about 10 main digis)
but there will be no QRM to surrounding regions.  Conversly, if he had used WIDE6-6 instead,
then those packers would QRM almost a DOZEN SURROUNDING regionS and over 140 digis
in all directions! . Actually, the size
of SSn-N doesnt really matter since it will hit every digi <i><B> once</i></B> 
in a limited area, and no more.  
See the example:
<P>
<IMG SRC="newN/mdmapw66.gif" height=300 width=300> <img src="newN/mdmapm66.gif"height=300 width=300>
<P>
<B>UPDATE:</B> The above left photo was typical of what we used to see on RF in the Baltimore
area prior 2004 and the New-N paradigm.  . To see how this mess has been reduced under 2 years 
of progress under the New-N Paradigm, see the
<A HREF="newN/DC-digis.GIF"><B>Jan 2007 map</B></A>.

<P>
<B>PATH TRACING USING THE SSn-N PATH:</B>  SSn-N (using the old UIFLOOD
paramter at the DIGI sites), would not normally be traceable. . But if users use the path of
WIDE1-1,SSn-N, then the path does become traceable at least with regard to the first
and last digi used. . If DIGI Sysops enable SSn-N support using the command: UIFLOOD SS,30,ID, 
then these paths will be always traced with the FIRST and LAST digi in the path, 
no matter how many hops are taken.  . This
is a tremendous benefit for network management. . 
This packet arrives as DIGI1,WIDE1,DIGIn,SSn* showing the first and last digi used.

<P>
<B>UHF across SSn-N Region Lines:</B> if you live on a border town and want to always be
able to see the other region's SSn packets, simply put up a cross band digipeater that
hears the 144.39 SSn packets from the other region, but digipeates those to a local UHF
frequency. .  To see the other region's SSn packets, just tune to that UHF channel without any QRM
to your local 144.39 operations.

<B><U>Fix #5, Labeling the New n-N Paradigm digis:</B></U>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P> 
The New-N paradigm also includes educating users. . THe biggest step is to be sure that every
digipeater announces its capabilities to users. .  Most importantly
are the new S, L, 1 and P overlays for the new settings on the digipeaters. . The <B>"S"</B> 
fully support WIDEn-N and SSn-N for <i>State or section</i> routing. .  The <B>"L"</B>
digis are the same but are <I>limited</I> and do not support SSn routing, 
and the <B>"P"</B> digis are old Paccomm Trace digis that have been configured to 
support WIDEn-N. . One-hop digis in extremely high density areas
 (like in LA) and fill-in WIDE1-1-only digis will show a "1"  
to indicate they are an enforced 1-hop digis.
<P>
<B>SECONDLY, </B> as part of user education, ALL digipeaters should show their New-N
settings in the position comment text of the DIGI's beacon. . 
See <A HREF="newN/n-n-overlays.txt"><B> the Details on Overlays and the
proper form for the Position Comment Text</B></A>.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=4>
<B><U>Fix #6, Proportional Pathing for DIGI beacons!</B></U>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P> 

One of the biggest loads on the network prior to this New-N Paradigm was simply the
flooding in all directions at all distances of the individual DIGI beacons.  Many
digis were sending out their beacon to 4 and 5 hops in all directions every 10 to 
30 minutes.  There is no need for this spam. . So part of the New-N paradigm  was
to come  up with the <i><B> Proportional Pathing </i></B> algorithm that kept
the information update rate at 10 minutes in the immediate direct range of the
digi so that passing travelers would be informed, but then the rate was much less
for more hops to cut overall load on the network and out-of-area spam.
See <A HREF="newN/ProportionalPathing.txt"><B> Proportional Pathing</B></A>.
<P>

This Prportional Pathing was easy to implement in the New-N Paradigm in all KPC3+ digis by simply
loading the four LTexts with the identical beacon, but then setting up four
different timings and four different paths.  The result is a local DIRECT packet once
every 10 minutes, but then a 1 Hop path once every 30 minutes and a 2 hop to surrounding areas
only once every hour.
<P>


<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=4>
<B><U>Proportional Pathing for all Trackers and Mobiles:</B></U>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P> 
The original APRS design uses a Decaying Algorithm to send new data more frequently than
old data, and make each later copy less and less often if the packet is unchanging.
Most follow-on APRSclones, and mobiles, however, ignored this fundamental principal and transmit
far too much duplicate unchanging info. . We need mobiles to use <B>direct</B> and 
local <B> 1 hop </B> paths more often than <B>2 or 3-hop</B> paths. . 
This is called Proportional Pathing. . It means that mobiles will send at a ONE
minute rate to maintain good local situational awareness, 
but every other packet is sent LOCAL-DIRECT. . Every 2 minutes
it goes via WIDE1-1. . Every 4 minutes it goes via WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1.  And
if Proportional-Pathing is set to 3, then once every 8 minutes it will go via
3 hops using WIDE1-1,WIDE2-2. .  This technique cuts the load on the network
by a HUGE factor since high-rate mobiles with long paths was one of our biggest
problems. . Also, this solves the problem of adjustments between areas.
A setting of Proportional Pathing = 3 should be OK just about anywhere, with only
a 3 hop packet once every 8 minutes, but still minimal latency every 1 minute in
the immediatel area.
. Fortunately, Kenwood included Proportional Pathing in the new D710 radio.
See <A HREF="newN/ProportionalPathing.txt"><B> Proportional Pathing</B></A>.

<B><U>TEMPn-N DIGIS for Emergencies and Field Day:</B></U>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
APRS consists of over 1000 permanent digis across the USA.  But there is a vast
un-tapped resource of thousands of more digis that can be used in emergencies
if needed. . These are the D-700 mobiles that can act as digis. . <B>Normally</B>
we want all these mobile digis <B>OFF</B> to avoid added QRM on the network.  But we
need a way to use them if needed. . The Solution is to set these radios' UITRACE parameter
to <B> TEMPn-N </B> permanently. . Because they are not
WIDEn-N they normally will not digipeat anything. . But anyone, at any time,
needing a path out of an area without digi coverage, can attempt a TEMPn-N
packet to use any nearby D700 as an automatic digi.
<A HREF="TEMPn-N.html"><B>See the TEMPn-N page.</B></A>
<P>
<B>TEMPn-N FOR FIELD DAY:</B>  Another advantage to the TEMPn-N system is the
current ARRL Field Day rules which prohibit APRS unless a temporary digi is used
for FD. . Instead of trying to re-configure all the digis for FD, we can now
just use TEMPn-N because this temporary path could always be there!

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
Look again at the map of user density below.  Imagine concentric rings around the HIGH density
areas. . To limit to only 2 hops in the RED areas, then digis in those areas must not 
support anything above WIDE2-2. . The next tier of digis out from these areas need to trap 
3-3 and above packets.  The next tier of digis out, has to trap 4-4 and above, etc. . 
And almost everywhere we need to trap 5-5 through 7-7. . Any area that needs big N's should
solve the problem with more IGates, not longer paths.

<B>APRS FUNDAMENTALS:</B> APRS can ONLY work at the local level on RF.  It is only a 
1200 baud channel shared by your nearest neighbors. . It can only work if
you and your neighbors understand how it works and its limitations and you are
not QRM'ed to death from packets from out-of-area. . The following table
shows the BASIC ASSUMPTIONS about the goals of an APRS network:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="newN/basics.gif">
<P>
<B>THE ALOHA CONCEPT:</B>
The 1200 baud 144.39 channel can only support an average user load of about 60 to 100 or so
APRS stations or objects in an RF domain based on the typical transmission rates and number
of digipeaters and number of hops. .   
<A HREF="aloha/aloha50.txt"><B> See the breakdown and analysis</B></A>. . This is because
any greater load than 100% channel capacity guarantees lost packets due to collisions. . 
The size of your area that holds the number of users capable of generating 100% channel
capacity we call your ALOHA circle.  

You are responsbile to make sure that your packets get to your
surrounding ALOHA network but no further so you do not add QRM to other networks.

<B><U>FIX #7:  The ALOHA Circle:</U> </B>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
Every APRS software should calculate and display the ALOHA circle for its user. . It should 
be overlayed on every map so that it is never out of mind. . But even without
the ALOHA calculator built-in, users can still get a good estimate from FINDU.COM. . 
Simply EDIT-COPY this URL into your browser with YOUR APRS station callsign on the end:
<P>
<B>http://map.findu.com/WB4APR-9</B> <= your call here
<P>
That FINDU page sorts your 60 nearest APRS stations by range and so the range
to the last person on that list is the radius (or range) of your ALOHA circle. . This
list of stations is your APRS ALOHA Neighborhood. It also includes which digipeaters you 
may need to hit, to be able to communicate with them. . More importantly, your packets
should not go beyond this circle routinely. . 
In Southern California, your ALOHA circle may only
be 15 miles and  you may only need ONE hop to hit everyone. . In WYOMING, you may need
more hops....  
<P>
The ALOHA circle is automatic now in all copies of APRSdos (APRSmax after 
APRS871.zip). . See Map plot above. . There is also an <i>add-on</i> for UIview, and
the next release of WinAPRS should have it too. . 
It computes and maintains a plot of the yellow ALOHA range circle on
all map zooms. Around Baltimore it is about 45 to 55 miles depending on the number
of mobiles at any time. . Also displayed below is the MAP-PLOT-HOPS command that shows
a plot of the number of hops it took for surrounding digis to reach me. 
MAPS-PLOTS-USERS shows the same plot of user hops. . 
Notice that 2 hops will get one EVERYWHERE within this Aloha Circle even though there
are 13 digis in that area!

<IMG SRC="digis/digihops.gif">

<i>Note, that these PHG circles are the new half-size APRS standard which more closely
represent a MOBILE's range. . The actual RF range of these digis
to fixed stations and other digis is TWICE that shown above.)</i>

<B><U>Fix #8: Alt-Input Channel on 144.99:</U> </B>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>

Currently what your digi hears on its input is 98% from out of area, thus,
you only get in when you overpower the distant QRM. . But this does not work for
low-power devices. . The simplest local way to improve local reliability in the 
presence of QRM at the digi is to move local users to their own input channel
such as 144.99 (+600 from .39) <i> if available in your area </i> 
which simply then cross digipeats back to 144.39 where 
everyone listens.  This simple SYSOP solution can drastically improve local channel 
reliability! See how to <A HREF="newN/altchannel.txt">

<B><U>Fix #9: TURN HID OFF IN THE DIGIs:</U> </B>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>


HID OFF: . First turn HID OFF. . This ID packet is not an APRS format and 
uses the same path as the UNPROTO and goes out every 10 minutes if on.  . 
This, plus a bad UNPROTO path of 3 hops generates almost 100 packets per 
hour <i>per digi</i> in the area. . But turning HID off and using the 4 LT PATHS and
4 BLT timings can reduce this kind of QRM by a factor of 4! .  
<A HREF="digis/digi-rates.txt"><B> See digi-rates.txt</B></A>. . The APRSdos heard display below
shows the large number of dupes from digipeaters that have HID on, and that also are
using the poor dupe-generating WIDE paths and not using the  4 BLT/LTP/LT settings for best digi efficiency.

in a local packet every 10 minutes, but only one every 30 minutes at one

by half! . The HEARD display above shows how failure to use the smart beaconing
method on the digis and using the old WIDE paths really generate
lots of dupes.

Please revise these <A HREF="newN/PacComm-settings.txt"><B>PacComm Settings </B></A>.  
The original PacComm TNC's back in 1996 gave us the first callsign-substitution 
capability in APRS. . We called these digipeaters "TRACE" digis and use an overlay 
<B>T</B> to designate them.  But they do not support the much more efficient 
WIDEn-N type of routing and were holding back the ultimate improvement of our 
network in <A HREF="digis/digis-t.gif"><B>in some areas</B></A>.  . In all these
areas, paths using RELAY and WIDE were still being used. .  These cause from 3 to 5 times as
many duplicate packets. . To prove this to yourself, capture an hour of packets from your TNC and
then run the program 
<A HREF="aprstest.exe"><B>download</B> APRSTEST.EXE</A> to analyze the results.  
Below is the result for the Baltimore area:
<P>
<IMG SRC="newN/aprstestpix.gif">
<P>
Notice how 45% of all packets come from only 25% of the users using <B>W,W,W </B> paths. . Also notice
how simply switching to WIDE2-2 is more than 5 times more efficient than <B>W,W,W</B> and twice
as efficient as <B>W,W</B>!  .  But this can be fixed, 
by encouraging the new WIDE2-2 universal recommendation. . And the old PacComm digis can support 
this New n-N Paradigm and become a <B>P</B> digi
by simply supporting WIDE1-1,WIDE2-2,WIDE2-1 and WIDE3-3 as ALIASES.

<B><U>Fix #12: Update the very-high-hear-too-much digis:</U> </B>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>
To make APRS grow, cell size must get smaller to keep within the ALOHA limits in 
any one RF area. . High digis can be good if the number of hops of all users is
restricted. . But, in generally flat land, more users may require more, but lower digis,
and  restricting the number of hops. . 
If you can reduce what the tall-hear-too-much-mountain-top sites hear to only
DIRECT packets (and no surrounding QRM) they can support over 100 users...
See the very-tall digi problem in the LA basin in Southern
California. . There are several options for the tall-super-site digis depending
on your area:
<LI> Option 1:  Simply trap all paths to 1 hop.
                (It can still be used for directed paths beyond 1 hop.)
                <A HREF="fixingLA.html"><B>See the fix for Los Angeles</A></B>
<LI> Option 1+  You should also reduce what all surrounding digis are re-transmitting as well.
<LI> Option 2:  Move its RX to 144.99 (if avail) so that it has a clear input channel for low-power trackers

<LI> Option 3:  Move its TX to UHF so it can still hear everything but wont QRM anything

traces but with more overhead. . Choosing the optimum uses of these besides the 
original WIDEn-N and TRACEn-N and using the ALIAS list as a trap for large N
paths, can drastically reduce out of area QRM overnight. . Here is what we can accomplish:

<LI>Eliminate the multiple dupes of the old RELAY and WIDE (and TRACE and SS) systems.
<LI>Encourage the use of <B>WIDEn-N</B> (with small values of N. N=2) 
<LI>Encourage lower values of N to reduce flooding QRM from out of area.
<LI>Change UIFLOOD from WIDEn-N flooding to the local region SSn-N or section communications
<LI>Move WIDEn-N to the UITRACE parameter so that all paths are traceable.
<LI>Use the UIDIGI ALIAS list to Trap WIDEX-X paths for large values of X but allow at least one hop.
<LI>Both of these put <i>sysops</i> in control of their networks and drastically reduce DX QRM independently of user settings!.

<B><U>USER EDUCATION:</U></B> 
<FONT COLOR="#000000">
The most important value of the New-N Paradigm is the great simplification of
paths making universal APRS User education practical. . All the legacy paths before
were just making it too dificult for the users. . Now it is simply WIDEn-N with small N.
Done. The New n-N Paradigm
tools are very powerful, but it still boils down to fundamentals. . 
Use only what will get you to your nearest 60 to 100 users. . Anything else is QRM.
<P>
<B>BENEFITS of the new n-N paradigm:</B>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="newN/benefits.gif">

<P>
<B><U>WHAT THE USER SEES:</U></B>
<BR>
The bottom line is what does the user see. . And this is the crux of the whole idea.
In the past, we could not train the users because there was no single set of instructions that
worked everywhere. . Every area was disintigrating APRS with local hacks that make it
impossible to tell users what to use. . So my<B> NEW n-N paradigm</B> has as its
whole obejctive to get APRS back to a single set of user parameters that will work
everwyhere locally, yet still provide all the power of APRS for other applications:
<LI>GENERAL MOBILES:........ WIDE2-2
<LI>LOCAL MOBILES:............. WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1  (if there are FILL-IN digis in the area)
<LI>HOME STATIONS:............ WIDE2-2 (or 3-3 in eastern USA distant rural areas)
<LI>STATE OPERATIONS:...... WIDE1-1, SS3-3 as needed
<P>

<B> OFF-LOADING WIDEn-N TRAFFIC:</B>
<P>
For areas that still want to see
distant traffic
into other SSn-N's or larger DX N's of traffic from all over, it is easy to 
terminate
adjacent OTHERn-N traffic from outside your area into UHF where it enters your area. . Then,
anyone who is interested, or IGates or other processes can tune in the OTHERn-N traffic 
as needed as shown in the sketch below.
All it takes is a typical TNC set to digipeat the OTHERn-N traffic it hears on 144.39 
and transmit it to a local UHF freq.
Done.
<P>
<IMG SRC="newN/widenUHF.GIF">
<P>
The 2004 image below shows how 50% of the digis in the mid-atlantic area were NOT WIDEn-N
and so in general, we were suffering from the severe DUPE problem of using the old
RELAY and WIDE paths. . But this is rapidly changing as eveyrone endorses the
New n-N Paradigm.
<P>
<IMG SRC="newN/widen.GIF">

<P>
<B>Collisions and Lost Packets:</B> There is no way to know the reliablity of your network
from general statistics of packets heard, because you cannot tell what you DON'T HEAR! . 
A channel that is 800% overloaded and only passing 1 out of every 8 possible packets can
sound identical to one that is 50% loaded and passing 100% of every packet for everyone... 
SO, one the only way to really measure actual performance by using "probes". . 
Probes are simply known packets at known rates from "intended user stations" in the 
"intended areas of coverage" that tell you exactly the performance of your network. . See
<A HREF="newN/probes.txt"><B> PROBES or PHGR</B></A>.  
To implement this, we simply add one byte
to the existing PHG construct.  We call the result PHGR.
<P>
<B>THE ID/NOID ISSUE:</B>  Another thing that was quite broken in the 
old APRS network was the inconsistent setting of the ID/NOID parameter. . 
This determined how a WIDEn-N packet appeard on receipt and whether or not 
the INITIAL or LAST digi was identified.  . Just seeing a digi listed it was
imnpossible for anyone but the digi owner to know which it meant because only
he knew the setting of the ID/NOID parameter. . For years we tried to get it 
set to NOID so that the FIRST digi could be identified by using the path of
WIDE,WIDEn-N. .  But this causes dupes. . Now, we solved this problem by moving WIDEn-N support
to the TRACE parameter so all WIDEn-N paths are now traced.
<P>
Further UIFLOOD is now used for SSn-N and we can enforce tracing bby setting ID to ON
so that the 1st and last digi are indentified if users use the path of WIDE1-1, SSn-N. . 
This packet arrives as DIGI1,DIGIn,SSn*.

<B><U>LINEAR LINKn-N BACKBONES:</U></B>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"> 
During emergencies and getting traffic out of an affected area, it is best to 
use a long series linear chain of digipeaters (usually on a separate frequency).
This is one way to get above the receommended N=2 limitation.  For example,
the <A HREF="at-golden-packet.html"><B>Annual Appalachian Trail Golden Packet</B></A>
event attempts to send APRS messages over 2000 miles of the AT by using LINK7-7
paths. . This system uses Traceable LINKn-N paths for messages (UITRACE) and
the shorter non-traceable HOP7-7 paths for positions (UIFLOOD parameter).
Although big-N 7 hop paths are used, they are only in one direction and so at most
only 7 packets are generated instead of the nearly 200 that would result from
an omnidirectional WIDE7-7 packet. 
<P>

<B>INTERSTATE ##LNKn-N PATHS:</B>  Using this similar technique, it is possible
to establish long chains of digipeater along some long distance interstates 
using the path name of ##LNKn-N. .  This greatly eliminates dupes since a 
packet can only go one direction.  A 90LNK7-7 packet for interstate 90 only 
generates 7 copies of the packet along Interstate 90 compared to almost 200 
packets for WIDE7-7.  . Thus it reduces QRM by an order of magnitude and the 
NETWORK limits the damage instead of being dependent on user education. . 
See <A HREF="newN/LINKn-N.gif"><B> A graphic example of possible LINKn-N systems through Virginia</B></A>
and a <A HREF="newN/midlantdigis.txt"><B>suggested (obsolete) list of all ##LNKn-N chains</B></A>.

<P>

<B>THE APRS-INTERNET SYSTEM:</B> The original (and present) purpose of APRS is to 
be a tactical real-time local digital communications system for reliable, quick 
exchange and display of important local information. . Although in 1997, Steve Dimse and Sproul 
Brothers began the APRS-IS (Internet System) to glue it all together, nothing in 
the APRS-IS detracts from that local definition. . 
The Internet simply allows distant stations to observe such local activity,
yet provides connectivity to the global reach of APRS messages. . 
Thus, to some people, just making the nearest IGate is sufficient for the majority 
of their conectivity needs.  
<P>
So, how far is any station from the nearest Igate?  
<P>
The image below shows
the number of hops to an Igate for all of California. . Notice that MOST stations are 
only ONE HOP or less from an IGate and almost everyone is within 2 hops!

<P>
<B> ALOHA NETWORKS: </B>  APRS is a random network based on random transmissions of 
data among many users trying to share a channel. . This technique was well studied back 
in the 60's and is called an ALOHA network for where it was first developed at the
University of Hawaii.  It is the basis for most data networks which evolved into
what we know of as the ARPANET and now the INTERNET and other protocols. . Click for the
<A HREF="aloha/ALOHA.txt"><B> original definition of an ALOHA system</B></A>.
<P>
Basically the channel must be quiet most of the time, so that a sender will have a 
good chance of a successful transmission. . You can add more and more users, but eventually
you get to the point that adding more users only adds more collisions, and the net 
reliability goes down drastically. . If you add up the statistical load of about
60 or so APRS users, their packets equal a 100% busy channel. . Any more and the network suffers.
So, how many users are there in range of your digi?
<P>
<B>If your digi hears too much then its reliability for local users is poor!
<BR>In this context, LOWER is BETTER (just like CELL phones have grown, by going to smaller
and smaller cells!).</B>
<P>
<B><U>CHECK YOUR DIGI:</U></B>
Here is a list of  all digis in the world heard by FINDU in Dec 2004. . It is
surprising how some of these digis appear to hear so many stations direct.
If your digi and its neighbors actually does hear over 150 DIRECT, then the 
best way to prevent channel saturation is to implement the New-N Paradigm
and have surrounding digis limit the number of hops and by all means to
eliminate the obsolete RELAY and WIDE paths. . 
Not limiting the QRM by these techniques is a good indication
that reliability of low power and distant users will suffer badly. . The RANGE shown
here is computed from your PHG values. . If they are unrealistic, consider reducing
the PHG numbers to better match reality. . Remember to use Height-Above-Average-Terrain
and not just the "altitude" of the digi:
<LI><A HREF="digis/digiphgu.txt"><B>The Dec 2004 Digis List </B></A> sorted by Number of Users

<P>
Of course, these numbers are inflated due to a number of non-RF stations that also 
get counted but it is representative. . Best to look at exactly what is in the 
footprint by going to <i>map.findu.com</i> and looking at the <i>nearby</i> 
stations to see what exactly is there. . 
If there are that many RF users in range, then the APRS community in that area must 
add limits to n-N traffic to reduce the hearing range of these big digipeaters
to better serve their local users. .  Here are a number of things you can do:
<P>
<LI> First get everyone to use WIDE2-2 or less
<LI> If there are nearly a hundred users in range of one digi, consider enforcing only 1 hop through that digi
<LI> Consider switching the input of the BIG DIGI over to 144.99 (if available in your area) to hear low power trackers.
<LI> Or switch the output over to UHF so that its capacity can double. . (Users monitor the UHF output)
<LI> Measure your own reliable local network range using
     <A HREF="aloha/ALOHAcir.txt"><B> his own ALOHA-Circle</B></A> and reduce his path to match it.
<LI> Add more LOW-LEVEL local digis, or digipeat across town through a neighbor (who doesnt hear the QRM the digi hears)
<LI> Ignore big N WIDEn-N QRM at your digi with the new 
     State SSn-N and large N ALIAS TRAPS of the New n-N paradigm.
<LI> Convert high-site digis (that hear too much) to UHF backbone operations. <B>(See below)</B> 
<LI> Make sure there is an IGate within the footprint of most high density digis 
    
<LI> for the UHF outputting high-site digis, add a UHF receiver at the local IGate
<LI> Mark all PERMANENT Igates with the "GATE" with an "I" overlay so everyone can see
     which Igates are permanent
<P>
<B> APRS Channel Throughput:</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="aloha/ALOHAsim.jpg">
<P>
The above screen capture of the APRSdos program called SIMULATE.BAS shows how this 
program can be used to simulate the throughput on any kind of ALOHA channel. . In this
example it shows how 85% of the 40 stations all with a brand-new packet of information 
will be successful in getting at least one successful digipeat of that new information
in the first 8 minutes. . This example caused about 280 packets to be generated
using the APRSdos decaying algorithm to decay the retry-time after each attempt so
that new data is transmitted more often, and old data decays down to much lower rates
to preserve channel capacity.
<P>
Many popular APRS systems, unfortunately, use a constant transmission rate of X packets 
every Y period of time which results in a DOUBLING of QRM (over 480 packets) being generated
for only a 2% improvement in throughput over the same 8 minutes.

<B>UHF BACKBONE SOLUTION!:</B>
<P>
See the all-new <A HREF="superlan.html"><B>SUPER-LAN CONECPT</B></A>
that has evolved into its own WEB page due to recent discussions and development
on the APRSSIG. . The rest of this page was incorporated into this new page...
<P>
In areas where High-Site digis are hearing far too many packets, is to convert those
digis to output only on a dedicated UHF frequency. . This instantly doubles throughput
by going duplex, but even more importantly it can gain up to an order of magnitude
improvement through how it listens to 144.39. . 
<A HREF="newN/highx.txt"><B> See the original BACKBONE plan</B></A>. .  But remember
that we think it is now easier to start not with a BACKBONE, but with a centrally
located <A HREF="superlan.html"><B>9600 BAUD SUPER-LAN CONECPT</B></A> since
it only takes one person to do it, instead of a lot of multi-site coordination..

<P>
The following sketch suggests how such a high digi can be converted to UHF in one 
major metropolitan area and can still communicate to another adjacent Metro area,
but without burdening 144.39 and without any new logic other than the same kind of
processing already standard in any IGate:

The above backbone assumes that a single central site can hear all the smaller-lower
digis in a mstropolitan area. . But this concept can be extended to numerous such
high site digis as in the following diagram. . Here, three high-site digis can all
hear over a dozen lower-local digis, yet they can still share all packets on the
backbone using a single 9600 baud data stream:
