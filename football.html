<B>Annual 13th Company Football Run:</B> At noon Friday, 8 Dec, almost 150 midshipmen from the 
13th Company began running the Army/Navy
 game football 125 miles from  Annapolis to the stadium in Philly to arrive the next morning for the Saturday Game. <B><i>This page is constantly in work to keep up to date, so if it does not

<B>USNA Radio Club Communications:</B> For the last 32 years, the 
<A HREF="http://www.usna.edu/AmateurRadio/"><B>USNA Radio Club, W3ADO</B></A> (one of the oldest
ECA at USNA since 1928), with the
help of the AERO Satellite Lab, maintains comms and tracking of the runners using 
the same kind of amateur radio GPS position reporting  technology used in the Academy's 
<A HREF="http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/satstation.html"> student satellite projects</A>. 
The small cadre of FCC licensed and other interested
midshipmen in the USNA radio club, W3ADO, provide communications support for the Brigade during this
Football tracking event and the midshipmen Sea Trials in the spring.
<P>

Actually, once you are on the google page, you can also simply hit the <B><i> select all</B></i>
link to include all hamradio callsigns on the same map, then zoom around to see all surrounding vehicles.  
You will also see all of the other Ham radio operators using our APRS tracking system developed
here at USNA. 
<P>

The remainder of this page shows how we used to do it, starting with hand-drawn maps back in
about 1996 through about 2005 or so.  Then we started simply linking to Google maps to do the plotting.  Please also see 
<A HREF="http://www.chryseis.be/~bvh/starlabs/aprn/"> how our on-board camera Automatic Picture
Relay Network (APRN)</A>
can now work (though not implemented on the chase van this year).

<B><i>Go Navy - Beat Army from Space:</i></B>  In 2005, the USNA radio
club made contact with the crew of the space station and bantered lively about
the game.  See the 
<A HREF="football/fball2005.html"><B> 2005 details </B></A> or 
<A HREF="football/ISS-W3ADO.html"><B>hear the audio</B></A>.

<P>
This system is called the Automatic Position Reporting System 
<A HREF="index.html"<B>(APRS)</B></A> and is operated
entirely by volunteer Amateur Radio operators.  Over 30,000 ham radio operators worldwide
use this system routinely for public service and disaster preparedness.
All you need to know is someone's callsign and if they are transmitting their APRS
position, then APRS can not only find them, but the network also supports brief messaging
as well.  The satellite
images are from on-line databases and the web page overlays the live GPS coordinates on them.

The following section was updated in real time* via amateur radio link whenever
 new images were received from the lead vehicle. Most images were taken by the handheld
 Ken-Cam during changes in runners at each of the legs.  (Also, see 
 <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/fball98.html"> 1998's Photos)</A>.
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/fball99.html"> 1999's Photos)</A>.    Here are the new photos as they came in
via HAM radio:.

<P>
These images are transmitted back live via Amateur radio using what is called SSTV, Slow Scan TV.  HAMS have been doing this for over 30 years, but now with WEB technology, we can instantly post these live images to our WEB page too...

<P><B><A HREF="aprn.html">APRN BACKGROUND:</A></B> APRN (Automatic Picture Relay Network) is a live amateur radio channel for the transmission of remote KEN-CAM images.  We can even automatically place the station on the map if he uses an attached GPS unit.  Thus this APRN web page is automatic and 
catalogs, indexes and makes available images instantly.  There is no 
better mechanism than APRN for diseminating real-time, in-the-field 
images from amateur radio operators in support of emergencies or public 
service events.
APRN augments the worldwide <A HREF="aprs.html">APRS </A> amateur radio position reporting and mesaging system by giving vision to remote and mobile operations.  <P><B>APRN </B>is a concept presented by Bob Bruninga, WB4APR at the Digital
Communication Conference in Chicago, 25 September 1998 and his robotic VISION system presented at the DCC in Baltimore, Sept 1997.
<P>
Here is also a replay of the <A HREF="football.html">1993 Army-Navy game football run </A> to NJ Meadowlands
<P>And here is a <A HREF="football/foot.html">picture</A> of the original GPS tracker built into a
football helmet.
