DISCUSSION ON VOICE OBJECT NAMES:                           25 Jan 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Several formats and plans were proposed and discusssed:

A: ;146.940- *111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrPHGxxxx PL107.3   club...
B: ;146.940- *111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrRNGxxxx PL107.3   club...
C: }146.940->APOBJ:!DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrPHGxxxx PL107.3   club...
D: }146.940->APOBJ:!DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrRNGxxxx PL107.3   club...
E: }146.940-X>APOBJ:!DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrPHGxxxx PL 107.3   club...
F: ;RPTRCL-R *111111z4612.74N/06320.46WrRNG0020 146.74- 110.9 Club
G: ;146.940- *111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBB88888888...

Plan A didnt work because the D700 did not display the freq
Plan B didnt work because the RNG took up too much room
Plan C worked well, but was not Unique on the APRS-IS
Plan D was attempted to get RNG to work, but it didnt
Plan E added an "X" byte to make each object unique on APRS-IS
Plan F does not show the frequency without operator action

We therefore recommend the OBJECT format G.  PHG cannot be used
because UIview does not support it, and also UIview does not allow
3rd party format to be used at all, or it marks all such digipeaters
as IGates (C, D and E).  OBJect format G allows for the 10x10x8 byte 
line wraps found on the front panel displays of the D7, D700 and 
HamHud.  The AAA... and BBB... are the two 10 byte fields displayed 
as 2 lines on the D7 and D700.  THe 888... are the added 8 bytes 
visible on the D700 only.

Here is some of the discussion on the APRSSIG:

> Regarding the WA5XYZ-R callsign format proposal:

I have no problem at all with an object 146.940-R.  But I do like it
a lot better than WA5XYZ-R because it gives the frqeuency at a glance
without operator intervention.  The -R helps make it unique.  And 
displaying only a voice repeater callsign in my opinion is a non-
starter, since no one I know of refers to voice repeaters by their 
callsign.  THey all refer to the frequency and that is what we want 
to show up on the front panel.

>(Bob, if you are doing lookups while you are in motion

If the object name is the freq, as I propose, then one does not have to 
do any "lookup".

My control head is mounted on the dashboard above the steering wheel 
where it is even easier to glance at than the car's instrument cluster.  
And since the frequency 146.940- of the OBJect repeater shows up on the 
display's station-LIST without me having to push any buttons, then it is 
hands free too.  The WA5XYZ-R method of having voice repeaters send out 
just anther callsign with an -R on the end and requiring the driver to 
push a button to see the frequency, is more distracting to the driver and 
lacks any ergonomics considering the mobile traveler's needs.

Yes, what I am proposing now is completely consistent with those 
recommendations.  That is, that the *info* needed by the traveler 
(in this case the IRLP or ECHOlink node number) shows up in the 
OBJECT name, so that it shows on the front panel of the radio 
hands-free.  We recommended putting the ER- or IP- in front of the 
object name so that when it was truncated on a 6 character GPS map, 
then the more important node number would still show on the map.  
Thus we get ER-123456 for ECHOlink and IRLP-8080 for IRLP and 
these show on the worst-case-6-byte GPS map as 123456 and P-8080.  

These are easy to distinguish at a glance from an object "146.940-"

But for this voice repeater application, I don't see that much value 
in focusing so hard on trying to get the digits to show on the GPS 
map.  What we are after here is not that, but the hands-free, 
heads-up-display on the front panel of the radio without pushing any 
buttons to show the traveler the recommended voice repeater for 
where he is right now.

Yes, but I agree with your other suggestion and that is that we do 
want to see these on the APRS-IS so we want them to be unique were
we can.  SO adding a -X or +X or -xy or +xy to the end can be used 
to select a unique character to make up to 62 of these objects unique
for each frequency.

Why not?  They already do.  The APRS-IS and all clients are already 
required to parse out the object name and the SENDERS call for every 
object, since attribution of the source of an object is required in 
the spec.  Only a few lines of code change can logically combine these 
fields to make all such objects unique.

I would never say that.  And besides it is unfounded anyway... 
for several reasons.  We are working very hard to make sure this
does work everywhere.

1) I live in the Baltimore/WashingtonDC area, probably the highest 
density of APRS and voice repeaters on the planet, over 100 voice 
repeaters and I just checked 50 digipeaters heard on RF.  So I think 
it is representative of a worst case scenario and a pretty good area
to consider the application.

2) With our population density, we have multiple 146.94 repeaters 
every 50 to 100 miles or so and yet we don't think that a 146.94 
object transmitted DIRECT from 100 miles away is going to be heard
by our local mobiles and cause a problem to them.

3) Yes we have tropo sometimes and we sometimes hear multiple 146.94 
repeaters in our area, but then it is doubtful that an adjacent 
146.94 repeater is also the #1 APRS recommended repeater in the next 
city too.  Thus, there will not be that many (local direct) 146.94 
objects competing during tropo with ours.

4) OK, say there is a string of 146.94 recommended travelers repeaters 
and during band openings these objects do come in.  So what.  What 
shows on the radio's display is still just 146.94- which is all that 
the traveler needs to see anyway to know what frequency to tune to.
If the TROPO is in, then he can work it too!

5) In an area such as you claim as DFW, then if multiple 146.94 
repeaters are all the recommended traveler repeaters and you want to 
distinguish them, then surely the APRS digipeater sysops who are 
putting these objects in the digipeaeters can agree on additional
one or two unique "-X" bytes to make them unique.  Say, 146.94-D for 
the Dallas one, 146.94-F for the FortWorth one, and so forth...

In any case, these recommended voice repeater frequencies showing up 
on the front panel station LIST hands-free, are far more valuable to 
the driver than seeing W5XYZ-R and W5APC-R, both of which the operator 
has to push a button just to see what frequency they are on.

So it still seems to me that the best object name should be 146.940- 
where the "-" is optional and also any of the 62 additional "-X" or
"+X" bytes are optional to make the repeaters unique in areas where 
tropo may be a problem.  For 10kHz repeaters, there are over 3600
-xy combinations to choose from.  So here is the current recommendation:
