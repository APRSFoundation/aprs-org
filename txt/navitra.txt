NAVITRA to APRS J-Gate DRAFT SPECIFICATION                   de WB4APR
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this spec is to suggest a mechanism for exchanging 
messages and data between APRS users and Japanese NAVITRA users via the
worldwide APRS Internet System.  NAVITRA is an AX.25 Mobile position
reporting system used in Japan on their domestic model D7 and D700 
equivalent radios.  Although it has no specific messaging capability, 
there are 20 bytes in each position packet that can be used for free text.  
This spec will define a message protocol within those 20 bytes that can 
permit very brief message communication across the NAVITRA(RF)-to-APRS(IS) 
interface.  

By definition, all packets on the APRS-IS will be APRS formatted.  
Japanese users desiring to view this data on the actual internet will use 
normal APRS client software.  This spec defines only how packets cross 
the NAVITRA(RF)-to-APRS(IS) interface before being sent to or from the
APRS-IS.  I will call this a "JGate" to distinguish it from an "Igate"
although they are otherwise identical processes in client software.
In other words, how NAVITRA RF packets will be converted to 
APRS format and how APRS packets will be converted to NAVITRA on RF.

POSITION DATA:  This is easy.  APRS authors simply add the $PNTS
NAVITRA format to their list of existing APRS formats they parse.  This
simple step immediately makes an APRS program NAVITRRA compliant as
far as being able to monitor RF in Japan and the worldwide APRS-IS.
This is the EASY and the MOST REWARDING step in integrating NAVITREA
users into APRS.

MESSAGES:  Normally the only packets that cross from the 
APRS-IS back to RF anywhere are primarily MESSAGE packets that have 
been recognized as being intended for a local RF user.  No other packets 
belong back to RF via that J-Gate except the occasional courtesy position 
report associated with such a message packet.

Given that the NAVITRA system has no specific message protocol, the only 
free text mechanism other than POSITION/ICON data is the 20 character 
"STATUS" field that is included in each NAVITRA packet.  THus the 
NAVITRA user only has the following user interface:

SENDING:    my_own_posit_data/Icon/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
RECEIVING   others_posit_data/Icon/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Current usage in Japan has NAVITRA users communicating between each other 
by adding ">TOCALL" at the end of the 20 byte text.  Sometimes only a 
callsign suffix is used ">XXX".  This should be easy to identify and parse.


POSITION DATA NAVITRA(RF)-TO-APRS(IS):  
--------------------------------------

But before we get into the details of the text or "message" bytes, we must 
first define the standard conversion for position data.  In the NAVITRA 
data, the position packet can either be the station's present position, a 
Waypoint, a Starting point or an Ending point.  These get converted 
directly into either an APRS station position, or APRS objects.  But almost
all packets are of the "O" type.  The others are RARELY used:

NAVITRA FORMAT:   $PNTS,V,I,DD,MM,YYYY,HHMMSS,LAT,N,LONG,W,$

CONVERT TO APRS FORMAT (based on the 'I' Byte):
APRS(I=0): @DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$CSE/SPD/xxxxxx...    A posit
APRS(I=S): ;XXX-START*DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$xxxxxx...  Start Pt
APRS(I=E): ;XXX-END  *DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$xxxxxx...  End Pt
APRS(I=I): ;XXX-WAYPT*DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$xxxxxx...  Waypoint
APRS(I=P): ;XXX-OBJCT*DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$xxxxxx...  Object

Where XXX is the sending station's callsign sufFIX.  These suffixes are 
only used as the object NAME in the object formats.


J-GATE NAVITRA to APRS-IS MESSAGE FORMAT:
-----------------------------------------

Common usage in Japan has users placing ">TOCALL" at the end of any 
position text when it is intended for another station.  Sometimes this 
is only a sufFIX.  Our conversion is easy.

1) If the ">TOCALL" exists, then TOCALL becomes the APRS message address
2) If ">xxx" is shorter than 4 bytes of a callsign, then the message is 
sent to ALL and the entire 20 characters including the ">xxx" are included
in the message as is... Here are the examples that we can use for APRS 
conversions:

  
NAVITRA 20 byte TEXT  Converted to APRS FORMAT                     NOTES
--------------------  -------------------------------------------- ----------
message text >TOCALL  :TOCALL...:NAVITRA MSG: message text         Normal MSG
More message txt>XXX  :ALL......:NAVITRA MSG: More message txt>xxx Suffix msg
any other text, etc   [is not a message because the ">" is missing]

In these examples, the ">" character indicates it is a NAVITRA message 
for injection into the J-GATE.  WHat follows the ">" can be 4 things:

  >TOCALL    in this case, the conversion is straight forward
  >XXX       In this case, the conversion is to ?XXX
  >#         This will be a Bulletin Number #
  >          This will be an Email

But these last two are only ideas of how we can use this later...

TOCALL is variable length, from 3 to 6 characters.  There is no provision 
for SSID, since just like in APRS, a message to the root call will be 
accepted by all SSID's of the same call.  And since there is no ACK 
capability in NAVITRA, then there is no reason to specify or require an 
exact SSID match.  


APRS(IS)-TO-NAVITRA(RF) Message Conversion:
--------------------------------------------

Going from APRS-IS to RF requires the J-Gate to attach the sending 
stations previously captured position data to the message text.  Notice 
that this is limited in that only the latest packet from a given station
will be visible to the NAVITRA mobile user at a time, thus this message
capability is mostly only a one-liner type comm system.  Also, there are
no ACKS.  THus the message is transmitted 'n' times and it times-out.


APRS Formatted message text               NAV-TRA 20 char text
---------------------------------------   --------------------
:TOCALL...:message text                   message text >TOCALL
:BLN#GGG..:This is a GRP Bln              This is a GRP Bln>#

Notice that since this is an APRS-IS to RF conversion process, this 
process is only performed if the "TOCALL" of the message matches a 
locally received NAVITRA station.  In the case of the Bulletins, none of 
the worldwide bulletins will be gated back to RF by the J-Gate unless 
they have a 3 digit GROUP number.  In the NAVITRA protocol, there is 
provision for each packet to be identified with such a 3 byte GROUP call.  
The default wildcard is "000".  SO only bulletins originated on APRS 
specifically intended for NAVITRA users by these group calls will be 
J-Gated to RF in Japan.
