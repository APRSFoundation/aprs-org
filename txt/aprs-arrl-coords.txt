APRS AREA COORDINATORS                                    20 June 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a list of volunteer APRS coordinators for their areas.  In the
USA, these areas are usuually associated with the country's "ARRL
Sections".  This is because most ham radio volunteer communications 
are also organized around those boundaries.  Since APRS is supposed to
also support these public communications needs, then APRS has routing 
indicators by SSn-N sections too.  Therefore, we need someone to help
coordinate APRS usage in those areas.

This original list has been expaned to include international 
volunteers in other countries as well.  These countries are listed at 
the end...
