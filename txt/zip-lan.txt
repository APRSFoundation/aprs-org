ZIP-LAN.TXT   8.0            MULTI-PC APRS ZIP-LAN networks!

The ZIP-LAN concept is a trivial way to connect a classroom full of
PC's together to a single TNC so that students can all play with
the MIREX experiment.  In MIRMON, the MASTER mode is disabled so
that only the main PC connected to the TNC can transmit via the
TNC but all can listen and send messages back and forth between 
each other.  Here is an edited version of the normal APRS 
ZIP-LAN.TXT file...

    ZIP-LAN is a way of connecting many co-located APRS PC's together 
in the field so that they can all communicate with each other and a 
single TNC for powerful multi-PC APRS support of an event or emergency.  
A ZIP-LAN is just a single wire and ground, as in ZIP-cord.  Everyone 
listens for APRS data on the wire, and sends their RS-232 data to the 
wire.

   Only one TNC is needed and it puts everything it hears on the wire.
Therefore all PC's hear everything locally and from the TNC.  ALso they
can all transmit to each other and the MASTER.  For MIRMON, only 
the MASTER can transmit via the TNC.  Each ZIP-LAN PC can have its own 
call and can communicate fully among each other!  This is perfect
for MIRMON in a classroom.
 
The hardware concept is simple, Everyone sends and receives everything to
the single ZIP-LAN wire.  The diodes and 15 K reisitors provide the 
"ORing" function so that anyone can drive the ZIP-LAN wire.

Notice that the diode and 15K resistor easily fit in the DB-9 shell.
The recommended zip connector is nothing but two wire pigtails with
insulated aligator clips on the end.  You connect to the ZIP cord with
ordinary PINS pushed through the insulation.  At the MASTER you put the
diode and resistor between a back-to-back connector with the two pigtails
hanging so it can be inserted between any existing TNC and its PC. 
(come as you are)

DIGIPEATER OPERATIONS:  Notice that the MASTER does not send to the ZIP-
LAN but only to the TNC.  This means that there must be a digipeater on
the air for the MASTER's packets to get digipeated back to the LAN....
For MIRMON, this is an excellent confirmation that the MASTER's packets
got to MIR and back.  Until MIR comes into view, if you want the MASTER
to be able to send packets to the ZIP-LAN, there must be a temporary
digi in place, or switch to the APRS freqency in your area.
 
OPERATIONS:  Simply bring up all of the local PC's in ZIP-LAN mode, and
the master station operates normally.  Local PC's both send and receive 
on the ZIP-LAN, but only the Master sends to the TNC.  Master packets 
get to  the local PC's by being digipeated on the air...

Resistor values may need to be increased or decreased depending on
your particular serial port requirements.  I typically 10k for the
TNC and 15k or so for the others.  This should work over several 
hundreds of feet and up to 5 PC's or more.  Or MAYBE LESS.  I have 
used DIODE-ORing of RS-232 successfully for 19 years with good results.  

BAUDRATE!  Operating at 9600 baud will minimize collisions if there will 
be more than a few PC's generating traffic.  Collisions will garble 
packets half as much at 9600 as the 4800 default.  But long wire runs at 
9600 baud may also suffer errors in a noisy environment, so experiment 
and see what is best for your application.  ALL PC's and the TNC must be 
at the same rate.   You may consider adding 300pF Caps in each interface
to ground to bypass any RF that might get on the wire.

COLLISIONS:  Since the local PC's share the single ZIP-LAN wire for both
send and receive, there may be some collisions when the local PC's
transmit.  For this reason, where practical, the MASTER should be used
to generate the bulk of the outgoing traffic.  Also, since there can 
only be one POSIT ICON at the whole LAN location, the ZIP-LAN PC's will 
not originate any POSITS, except for the Master.  Similarly, enter
NONE for their STATUS beacons, unless needed.

     Theoretically, with a max'ed out 1200 baud APRS channel (36% busy), 
and operating the ZIP-LAN at 9600 baud, the LAN is only busy less than 
4% of the time so colisions should be minimal.

TNC INTERFACE:   The master is connected to the TNC in the normal fashion,
so it can handshake with the TNC as needed for configuration and changing
the UNPROTO path.  The other PC's can't touch it.
