24 Mar 2011 added Radiation Sensors - see aprs.org/aprs12/weather-new.txt
18 Aug 2010 updated Water height and symbols for water gages
11 Apr 2006 added water gages  - see aprs.org/aprs12/weather-new.txt

This file attempts to clarify many details about APRS weather formats.  Curt 
Mills was very helpful in identifying some of these original APRS SPEC 1.01
omissions.

In the RECOMMENDED complete WX format, the WIND SPEED does not have a 
"s" format identifier since it is in a FIXED position.  Thus if you see 
"s", then it is snow.
 
Only WinAPRS uses the verbose positionless Weather format which does
have this ambiguity.  Thus, it cannot be used to send Snow values.
But the WinAPRS "positionless" weather format is not recommended for 
further implementation anyway.

Yes.  I think only the original APRSdos and Xastir do this properly.  
Newer programs took the simpler approach of starting the count each
day at midnight...  But this is why we further defined three different
rain identifiers.  "p" is as above,  "P" is since midnight, "r" is
last hour.

The are all three bytes unless otherwise specified.

No. if the byte is capital "L" then it is a luminosity from 0 to 
999.  If the luminosity is above 1000, then the lower case letter
"l" is used.  Thus l123 is a luminosity value of 1123.  
Kinda cute isnt it..

> Snow 's' has ?? bytes?  Format?  (s1.25, s100.99)  

Three bytes.  S001 is one inch.  S1.5 is 1.5 inches.  S010 is 10 
inches.  Notice that fractions of an inch above 9 inches are not 
possible in 3 digits.

It is the three least significant bytes of the counter no matter what
units.  The assumption here is that it is just a raw bucket count and
the users of that station have to understand the specifics of that
counter.  Mostly it lets users see if the value has CHANGED from the
last reading.  This is not recommended.  These days it is better for
all raw WX stations to have a pic processor to put the data into the
original "COMPLETE" format.

No, they are just alternate symbols for a weather station.  They were
intended for use at National Weather Service sites to distinguish
real "calilbrated" weather reports from "amateur" home stations.

Yes, I have always accepted /W and \W interchangeably with /_ and \_.
thanks for finding the bug in the spec...

The spec allows "..." or "   " for the fields.  It also allows
any field to be absent, as long as it's not one of the few required
fields at the beginning.  I prefer dots as in "r..." so that the 
columns line up nicely even if a station has no rain gage.  The 
number of '.' or ' ' characters matches the field width.

Yes, they are variable.

Also, two new software type identifiers have been assigned:
 
"O" for Otracker, "K" for  Kenwood, "B" for Byonics, "Y" for Yeasu.
