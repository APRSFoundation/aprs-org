USE of the C bits in the SSID BYTE in AX.25 Confusion             9 Jun 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WB2OSZ offers this explanation:

The AX.25 spec says this about the "C" bits in the destination and source 
addresses.  Section 6.1.2, figure 6.1.

Frame Type        Dest.SSID C-Bit   Source SSID C-Bit
---------------   ---------------   -----------------
Previous versions        0                0
Command (V.2.X)          1                0
Response (V.2.X)         0                1
Previous versions        1                1

The two "C" bits must be the opposite of each other.  This is very important 
for the traditional "connected" mode.

I could find no mention of these two bits in the APRS protocol spec or other.

After spending a lot of time studying the AX.25 spec, I think "command"
would be correct.  The state diagrams, in the back, indicate that a UI frame 
that is not a "command" is an error.  APRS is built on top of AX.25 so we 
would expect it to follow the same rules unless explicitly said otherwise.

When this question came up before, I hacked together something to observe 
what is actually used in practice.

Source C Dest C meaning, examples.
-------- ------ ------------------
 
   0      0     (previous vers)   WXtrac,APRS+SA,KPC-3,Tiny Track,Xastir
   0      1     (command)   Uidigi, UIview, APRSISCE, APRSdroid
   1      0     (response)  Kenwood, Yaesu, APRSISCE
   1      1     (previous versions)   OpenTrack


We can have philosophical discussions about what they "should" be but the 
reality is that we find all 4 combinations being used.

Any implementation should simply ignore them for incoming frames.
