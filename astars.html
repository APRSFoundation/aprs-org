<B>ASTARS and this page began in the mid-90's</B> with the first Amateur Packet Radio relay satellites and 
experiments on the ISS and MIR and ultimately other amateur satelltes listed below.  ASTARS stands for 
APRS Satellite Tracking and Reporting
System and refers to digital relay satellites and the global APRS internet
linked system of ground stations that tie it all together into full time 24/7
access to the two live downlinks listed below.  
 
APRS satellite missions dating back to 1998 (see list below) also allow end-user-to-end user real-time digital 
data exchange typically between mobiles and handheld radios. . Text Messaging from handhelds
is easy using any of the Kenwood or Yaesu APRS walkie-talkies.
See the <A HREF="sset.html"><B> 2008 Satellite Simulated Emergency Test</B></A> page.

<P>

<B>Tracking LEO birds:</B> Although there are dozens of satellite tracking programs for predicting passes, 
there are also simplified manual methods that also work when you dont have access to a PC or the internet 
on a daily basis.
<A HREF="MobileLEOtracking.html"><B> See how</B></A>.  Or you can use prediction software to 
determine all the passes for a single day.  For example, see the 
<B><A HREF="fd/FD.txt"> pass plan </B></A> for Field Day 2002 when there were 9 amateur digital
relay satellites operational providing passes all day long giving excellent
satellite contact alternatives to the overcrowded Voice FM birds.  You also do not need full AZ/EL antenna 
systems since a simple <A HREF="LEO-tracking.html"><B>$70 TV rotator</B></A> can provide excellent signals 
98% of the time as good as the typical $700 AZ/EL rotator.
<P>

<B>Amateur Operating Areas:</B> Although congestion over the USA and Europe make communications 
challenging via many
of the FM voice satellites, the short duration of Packet make it orders of magnitude
easier.  This, plus the global connectivity of APRS groundstations make operating 
in any part of the world a breeze.  The map below shows how the density of amateur radio
operators across the globe is very uneven.  With the USA and Europe containing the highest
density and therefore, congestion, compared to remote areas such as Hawaii where amateur radio
operators have almost exclusive uncongested access. Remember, more than half of the world has nearly zero satellite uplink congestion, so if you travel in these less dense areas, take your
satellite HT and enjoy un-congested operation!

<A NAME="astars">
<B>ASTARS</B> is an Amateur Radio Mobile Tracking and Communications 
System for Reporting position, status, and messages to and from Handhelds and Mobiles
in distant locations via Amateur Satellites using off-the-shelf amateur equipment.
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/astars/W4HFZ-mobile.jpg">  [See W4HFZ's Installation]</A>.  Example digital
communicating Handhelds and Mobiles are shown below.  Further, using the remote 
control capability of these radios makes it possible to operate a complete
<A HREF="ao40/portor.jpg"> automatic tracking/tuning rotator controlled suit-case portable system </A>
that can be operated
over any length of 8 conductor wire.  Great for demos, or vacation operating from
your motel room.  See also the <A HREF="rotator1.html"> Rotator interface</A> and
<A HREF="D7xx/d700-faq.txt"> Click here for D700 SETUP</A>
<P>

<B>1200 Baud PSK ASTARS</B> was a sytem called <A HREF="traknet.html">TRAKNET</A>
 which was presented at the 1998 and 99 AMSAT conferences as a
1200 baud mobile satellite network using AO16 and IO26 (LO19 is inop) which have been   
authorized for live APRS tracking and position reporting.  PSK ASTARS was used by
<A HREF="football/fbsatsum.txt"> 16 stations</A> during the annual
<A HREF="football.html"> Army/Navy Footbal run</A>
and other special events.  It is a very viable capability for stations
with PSK TNC's or using 
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/dquagliana/upw/index.html">
KA2UPW's sound-card uplink capability</A>.  Since all birds share the
same 145.900 uplink, the goal was to set the UI-DIGI callsign on all birds 
to the SAME generic call, so that mobiles did NOT need to change any settings between 
satellite passes and therefore get over 12 passes a day from this constellation..
We had hoped to see SOUND-CARD only implementations of the special PSK
modems making AO-16 and IO-26
very popular 2-way digital communications satellites again, but no one has risen to the challenge..
<P>

<B>1200 Baud AFSK ASTARS</B> The TRAKNET concept was demonstrated many times during 
<A HREF="mirex.html"> experiments with the Space Station MIR </A> 
packet system and <A HREF="sarex.html">SAREX</A>. The Kenwood THD7 Handheld (or mobile D700)
with built in 1200 and 9600 baud TNC's can be used for two-way self-contained APRS 
communications via SAREX, PCsat, and ISS at 1200 baud.  During a 
<A HREF="astars/mir-ht.txt"> test in June 99</A>, over
55 stations conducted 2 way HT-to-HT message communications.  Although some think
that 1200 baud PACKET is passe', it is PERFECT for HT-SATELLITE digipeater 
communications.  The 9 dB advantage of 2m to a handheld 2m
antenna cannot be beat on any other band.  Satellites with this capability
are SAREX, PCsat and ISS.  (MIR, and SUNSAT have died).
<P>
<P>
<B>US NAval Academy Satetllites:</B> During the 30 years that WB4APR was at the Academy (1990-2020)
over a dozen APRS Amateur Satellites were ementored as student projects and many 
were launched.  See <A HREF="sats.html"><B> APRs Satelltie links</B></A>.  Starting about 2013 the
FCC was uncoorperative and fought all USNA studnet projects as being "government" satelliites
and not amateur even though the missions were 100% Amateur AX.25, and DTMF, and SStV transponders.
Fortunately, they approved PSAT2 and BRICSAT2 at the last minutes.
<P>
<B> 9600 BAUD ASTARS</B> became a reality when Kenwood
introduced the 1200/9600 baud APRS data mobile radios, the 
<A HREF="D7xx/TM-D700A.gif">TM-D700A</A> and the TH-D7(G) Handheld.  
These dual band data radios with built-in TNC's and front 
panel APRS displays make it possible to send and receive the very 
short APRS style comunications via any 9600 Baud PACSAT if digipeat
is enabled (such as UO-22 and ECHO). Thus, 
these two radios are off-the-shelf satellite data terminals ready for 
ASTARS and they need NO PC or other accessory.  They can send and receive
all data on the radio front panel with only the proper mobile whip antenna! (see below).
<P>
<B>INTERNET (SatGates):</B>
The presence of the Internet makes possible the linking
together of multiple disparate downlink sites all over the world to yield a tremendous
gain in reliability through space and time diversity reception.  These
 SAT-Gates combine all packets heard
into the existing worldwide APRS infrastructure 
 for delivery to any compatible APRS station in the network.
<A HREF="astars/PC2satgateA.txt"><B>See how to set up a simple SatGate using ALOGGER </B></A>
<P>
This WEB PAGE describes ASTARS, beginning with its Limitations, 
expected Operations scenario, the TMD700 and THD7  set up for mobile operation, 
Linking traffic to/from the worldwide APRServe system via SAT-Gates, 
how the SAT-Gates operate, and how the terrestrial APRS system can 
distribute satellite access times to the mobiles using minimum 
bandwidth on the terrestrial system.
<P>
<B>EXAMPLE:</B>  The APRS Mic-E format used by the Kenwood radios transmits
all of the following information in only 9 data bytes except for the
STATUS text which adds 1-for-1 to the length of the packet.  Thus,
a lot of infomation can be transmitted in less than 0.5 second per
mobile.  Here is an example pass as received on a Mobile D700:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="astars/mic-etbl.jpg">

<A NAME="SAT MODES"></A>

<P><B> MODES:</B>  The performance of the mobile-satelllite LINK is very dependent on 
the Satellite MODE and on the transmtter power.  This WEB page was originally written
around the concept of the existing Mode-J PACSATS (like UO-22 and ECHO), but it was modified to 
include the opposite characteristics of the Mode-B SUNSAT.  The characteristics vary by 
as much as 9 dB depending on whether the uplink or downlink is VHF or UHF.  Now with 
OPAL, ISS, PCsat and Sapphire we also have the traditional same-band digipeating too.
Here are the differences:

<LI><B>UHF DIGIPEATER:</B> Any satellite that digipeats back down on the same frequency band
as the uplink.  OPAL and Sapphire digipeat on 437.100, OPAL at 9600 baud and Sapphire at
1200 baud. But operating on UHF requires tunning opposite directions
+/- 10 Khz between receive and transmit.  Careful uplink tuning is required since neither
receiver was broadbanded for Doppler. 

<LI><B>VHF DIGIPEATER:</B> The ISS, SAREX, and PCsat digipeaters are on 2 meters and so
do not need doppler tracking since the Doppler is less than +/- 3 Khz.  This is the
ideal band and mode for simple access by users.

<LI><B>VHF up - UHF down:</B> This is the mode of all of the existing 9600 baud PACSATS
(UO-22 and ECHO, GO-32).  UPLINK to
the satellites on 2 meters is easy to do with an omni and 5 watts or more.  Conversly,
the UHF downlink from the satellites .5 watt transmitter with 9 dB more of path loss makes
the downlink very weak.  It takes 8 dB or more of gain and doppler tracking to copy
this downlink.  These satellites are ideal for handhelds or mobiles to INITIATE packets
to the satellites, such as travelers Position/Status or Messages.  Use a 20" whip
over a ground plane for these birds for the needed high angle gain for omni receive.

<LI><B>UHF up - VHF down:</B> SUNSAT was in this mode.  With the added 9 dB downlink
advantage on 2 meters, the satellite could be heard by any user with an omni antenna.
Conversly, the uplink on UHF required Gain antennas, and predicting doppler in the 
blind.  So Mode-B was a great way to RECEIVE message packets from satellites to handhelds.
ALthough the downlink is an easy to receive 9600 baud signal, the 9 dB penalty on the
uplink appears to require the 50w mobile or operating at 1200 baud on the uplink with
the Handheld.

<P>
<B>OPERATING LIMITATIONS:</B>  The 2-meter side of these satellite links are trivial
to do and work fine from any mobile omni antenna.  Thus PCsat, SAREX and ISS are currently the 
best ASTARS systems on orbit.   The difficulty of the UHF links in mode-B and mode-J
have several limitations that complicate the operational scenario on those birds:

<LI>  Due to multiple use of these satellites and frequencies, un-necessary congestion 
      on the uplink is to be avoided.

<LI>  The weak UHF downlink can only be received for the central 2 or 3 minutes 
      or less of an overhead pass on an omni mobile whip. 

<LI>  Such overhead passes only occur once or twice in the morning 
      and the evening per day per satellite at USA latitudes.

<LI>  Longer pass times and more passes are possible with a handheld 4 ele beam.

<LI>  Doppler tuning of +5, 0 and -5 is necessary for the UHF link in the middle of the pass
      for an omni antenna to get the longest possible operating times.
<P>
<A NAME="APRS MESSAGES"></A>

<B>APRS MESSAGES:</B>  For satellite operators unfamiliar with APRS messages,
 it should be understood that an APRS message is a single LINE of text.  Most 
messages stand alone, but are occassionaly strung together if it wont fit on
one line.  Here is a <A HREF="astars/W4HFZmessage.jpg">photo of a 15 byte message</A>
 received on the TMD700 radio.  (The maximum length is 64 bytes).

<P><B>APRS EMAIL:</B>  Simillarly, any APRS operator can initiate 
an EMAIL <A HREF="sset.html"><B> (see how)</B></A> 
message from his HT or mobile radio.  Just like other APRS messages, it
is also only ONE LINE and the one line INCLUDES the
full email address.  This forces brevity!  Here is an Email I transmitted from 
my D700 mobile enroute to work one day.  Notice that the SINGLE packet 
entered into the D700 was simply:
<LI>TO:EMAIL :wb4apr@amsat.org Testing Email via pacsat from my van enroute to work.
<P>
Yet, here is how it was received by my Email system after being SAT-Gated to APRServe
and from there, picked up by the EMAIL Engine at WU2Z's and shipped out as regular Email:
<P>
<IMG SRC="D7xx/email.jpg">
<P>
 
<B>OPERATIONS SCENARIO:</B>  To develop a viable satellite communications  
system that can communicate between mobiles and also to/from the 
worldwide <A HREF="http://findu.com">APRServe</A>  system within these limitations,
the following operating scenario is what we envision when fully operational:

<LI>  Via satellites, only use a -6 SSID (save it in a PM) so SAT-Gates know
      what Traffic to route to you.  (Not any terrestrial traffic).

<LI>  Your mobile objective is at least ONE posit per pass.  Setting to a
      one packet per minute seems to guarantee success.

<LI>  The fixed Kenwood 1/minute message rate and 5-times-timeout 
      is just about right for messages.

<LI>  SAT-Gates will only return traffic to you when the satellite
      is above 15 deg to you.  (it knows where you are...)

<LI>  Signal the SATGate to try lower angles with "QRZ" in your STATUS, 
      or by sending CUSTOM MSG 3 if you have a beam or lower horizon.

<LI>  PCsat has a dedicated downlink transmitter on 144.39 so that messages can be
      delivered to ANYONE in North America even without their prior arrangement.
      
<P>
<B>SAT-GATE OPERATIONS:</B>  Mobile-to-mobile communications works without
any special considerations on the satellite or on the ground.  But
the more useful application is sending and receiving messages to
any other APRS station via SAT-Gates that are monitoring the satellite 
downlink and serving as gateways into the world wide APRServe system.
These SAT-Gates perform the following functions:

<LI>  Monitor the downlink and capture all UI packets
<LI>  Monitor APRServe and capture MESSAGES for these stations
<LI>  Deliver these messages at a "fair" rate under these conditions:
<LI>    1)  The satellite is within 2000 km (above 20 deg) to mobile
<LI>    2)  It sees "QRZ" in the Mobile's STATUS text 
<LI>    3)  It sees CUSTOM-3 comment.  (Easier to turn on/off)
<LI>  Transmits these messages redundantly until digipeated twice.
<P>
<B>OMNI NO-TRACK SAT-GATES</B>  With simple antennas (such as a 19+" whip antenna over a large
groundplane (the roof of your car))
 any TMD700 radio becomes a no-track SAT-GATE downlink receiver.  The 
WHIP will bring in signals whenever the satellite is above
about 20 degrees which is about 5 minutes for a nominal high-elevation
pass.  Note, a 19+" whip is a 1/4 wave antenna at the 2m uplink, and 3/4 wave at the 435
downlink.  The 3/4 wave antenna has almost 8 dBi high elevation gain ideal for this application.
It is not good on the horizon, but mobiles do not see the horizon and the satellite
is 6 dB further away anyway.  See plots below.

<P><B> ADD A TV ROTATOR!</B> After monitoring the birds for a year with the whip,
I decided I would rather hear the other 2/3rds of all the data when the birds are below
20 degrees, and so I added a simple $20 rotator interface to my APRStk software to
control the ubiquitous 24 AC TV rotator that you can get anywhere.  See
<A HREF="rotator1.html"> my APRS Rotator </A>
<!-- <A HREF="http://web.infoave.net/~n4wyk/satcheaprotor.htm">APRS Rotator</A> //-->
 
<P> Unlike previous amateur satellite activity, we can combine the
outputs from a dozen such omni stations nationwide and the result is over a 99.96%
 chance of capturing every packet over the USA!  Even if only 4 stations at 
any one time have the bird in view of their station and even if they only 
have a 60% chance of decoding each packet, their combined probability is 98%. 
But if the original packet is replicated  TWICE, then this probability 
becomes 99.96%!  A Certainty!  
<A HREF="astars/88-9600.txt">(Even an $88 Alinco HT can be used as a downlink station)</A>
<P> <IMG SRC="astars/stns.gif"><P>
This map shows how 6 ground stations limited to solid downlinks only while the satellite
is above 30 degrees using only 20" whip antennas can see the satellite anywhere over
the USA.  Note, the signal above 30 deg is +7 dB closer and maybe +3 dB in the gain
lobe of the 3/4 wave whip for an equivalent of +10 dB.  THus no packets will be lost. 
 Actually, we would like to see a dozen such
downlink stations to provide the added reliability to 99.96%.  THis is easy to do.
We already have dozens of similar APRServe I-GATES.  All they need to do is add
a D700 at their station and a whip antenna... <B> NEWS! APRStk (see below) now AUTO
TUNES for any satellite in view!</B>
<P>
<B>RANDOM NO-TRACK-NO-TUNE SAT-GATES:</B>  Where can we find enough D700's
 for this project?  EASY!  In every parking lot and driveway across America!
Most D700 mobiles are not in use most of the time, but are installed in vehicles
with perfect sky visibility and with excellent low loss OMNI antennas.
Simply leave a 3 wire DB-9 wire by your driveway going inside to your APRS
system and plug it into the D700 every time you park.  Bingo, you are
contributing to the APRS downlink!
<P>
EASIER STILL!  Simply program a PM memory for the D700 TNC to listen on the satellite
downlink and Transmit on 144.39.  Then every packet from the downlink will be
digipeated to YOUR home station for entry into the APRS internet system.
Or, when your handheld THD7 is not in use, hook it up.
Why let these radios go to waste, when they could serve
others!  WOW, talk about a boot-strap nationwide Satellite Gateway system!
<P>   
<B>SATELLITES:</B>  In the 1990's the 9600 baud digital downlinks used the PACSAT protocol which is very 
effecient for delivering large files to many users. Our 1 packet every-now-and-then 
presence on  
the uplink is insignificant to others uploading to the bird.  The currently active PACSAT
satelilte offeing 9600 baud APRS conventional digipeating is 
<A HREF="https://www.amsat.org/falconsat-3/"><B>FalsconSAT-3</B></A>.
See the <A HREF="http://www.findu.com/cgi-bin/raw.cgi?call=pfs3-1&amp;start=144&amp;time=1"><B> Live Telemetry</B></A>,
and look for <A HREF="http://www1.findu.com/cgi-bin/pcsat.cgi"><B> user packets via PFS3-1</B></A>. 
<P>
<B>SATELLITE TRACKING AND PASS PREDICTIONS:</B>  APRS mobiles should only uplink during the
actual satellite pass to keep the uplink clear
 of non-essential transmissions.  To this end, we have two very good methods:

<LI> <B>Tracking Software (Obsolete):</B>  There are lots of trtackking programs, but historically, I added
Satellite tracking to APRSdos in the form of APRStk.exe.  It presented the satellite predictions 
on the APRS map and would auto-tune the Kenwood radios including doppler.  It would also rotate any 24V AC
cheap TV rotator towards each satellite for maximum singal. Great as a shack or office
monitor so you never miss a pass.  

It must be run within an already installed APRSdos file structure. See download info
below.  The screen shot
below shows how it tracks both APRS stations, and satellites and gives a 2 hour
pass prediction across the bottom letting you know what is coming up...

<P><IMG SRC="astars/aprstk0.gif"> 

<LI><B>Automated APRS Bulletins and Objects (Obsolete):</B>
Another program, APRSdata was a service that was designed to run on someone's local station, 
to update
the front panel of all Kenwood Radios with the azimuth and distance to any satellites in
view and also send out every 10 minutes a schedule of the next
80 minute pass predictions.  It did this by transmitting the satellites as APRS moving
objects on the terrestrial APRS network  (144.39) and by sending the schedule as a 
DX spot to the DX-LIST in the radios.  THis way, no one needed a 
tracking program, they would receive it live over the air on their radio front panel.

<P>   Using APRStk in this manner to alert everyone on the APRS frequency including
mobiles and handhelds to satellites inview can be thought of almost as a "WEB"
server to your radio's front panel.  The 10 minute schedule is transmitted to the
radio's  DX-LIST.  Thus, our mobile satellite users 
can get the PASS info they need without lugging along a laptop.
This shows you what the Handheld THD7 HT will capture and display
about the satellites.  First is the DX-SPOT list showing that there are three satellites
UO22, AO27 and UO14 coming up in the next 80 minutes and when.

Uplink and Downlink Frequencies, Doppler and distance to the satellite.  Just perfect for aiming your handheld
antenna.  For more details see <A HREF="satinfo.html">APRS Satellite Resources</A>.

<B>TM-D700 and TH-D7(G) SETTINGS:</B>
Here is a list of my minimum setups for the new Kenwood TM-D700 data mobile and TH-D7(G)data
handheld for front-panel-to-Satellite mobile communications via a digipeating
PACSAT in Mode-J or Mode-B:

<P> 
<B>TRANSMITTING:</B>  Notice, the new D7(G) has the DCD SENSE command so that
the TNC will operate full duplex in APRS mode.  BUT, In APRS mode, the D700 
does not have this ability to set the internal TNC to FULLDUPLEX. THus, while 
your D700 mobile receive BAND is receiveing data the 
radio will not transmit.  Understanding this problem will 
be your key to success.  If the Satellite has periodic quiet times on the
downlink (SUNSAT) then operate normally.  It will get a chance to key up.
But if the downlink is 100% in use
as is normal for UO-22 and all the other PACSATS, then
here are some ways to force a transmit:

<LI> Set to AUTO and then QSY occassionally the downlink long enough to silence rcvr
<LI> Set to PTT and kerchunk xmtr when Posit BECN is ready... (won't do msgs)
<LI> Set to auto and tune RX elsewhere to ignore downlink.  
<LI> Operate PACKET mode with laptop doing APRS (With FULLDUP ON)
<LI> Operate SUNSAT.  It downlinks only once every 5 to 10 seconds
     and is quiet the rest of the time.
<P>
<B>ANTENNAS:</B> Because of the short coax run in a car, and no need for a PREAMP, 
a simple 19+" 2m WHIP antenna in the center of your car roof is an ideal mobile 
OMNI antenna for both VHF and UHF satellites.
On UHF, the antenna is a 3/4 wavelength whip with
an 8 dBi lobe at high elevations which is ideal for the satellite near the
center of the pass (yellow plot below).  My D700 will capture packets when the
 PACSATS are above 25 to 30 degrees for a few minutes, (lower for UO14 and SUNSAT)
  But to gain the full downlink, a handheld
4 element or so UHF downlink antenna rotated in AZ, EL and polarity is
required.  Much experimentation in this area is needed.  Here is a plot of the
EZ-NEC produced gains of three whip antennas including the path loss due to range.
My 3/4 wavelength antenna picks up the sats at about 20 deg.  Better than shown here.

<P>
To validate the data for the 3/4 wave vertical, I built a 1575 MHz scale model of
the antenna AND car roof and connected it to a GPS receiver and my SIGPLOT.BAS program.
Letting it run all night, gives an all-sky GAIN PLOT using the satellite signal
strengths as the RF source.  Thus, over time, you get known RF from all angles and all
azimuths and the SIGPLOT program produces a real-world plot of actual antenna pattern
as shown below.  I did it twice, the Green is the 3/4 and Red is the 1/4 wave.  
Notice the high angle gain of the 3/4 at all angles above about 25 deg.  
Although the 1/4 is better down to about 10 degrees, the 6 dB greater path loss
due to the greater distance to the satellite (and trees and buildings) cancels
any advantage here for the weak PACSAT downlinks.
The car roof I modeled was the size of a compact sedan.

<B> TUNING MODE-J:</B>  UHF Down, VHF uplink.  Doppler tuning the UHF downlink is trivial to do by ear.  Although
 9600 baud data sounds
 just like open-squelch noise, it does have a "quality" to it that can easily
be heard by ear when the receiver is not centered in the data bandwidth.  All
passes begin at +10 KHz and move down in 5 KHz increments down to -10 KHz. It only
takes a fraction of a second to test QSY to hear if it is time to tune or not.  
Eventually you can hear when it is time...  For omni antennas where you wont 
hear the satellite on the distant horizon, then start at +5 and move twice to -5
during the brief pass.  SUNSAT and PCsat had a wide UHF uplink receiver and
so only -/+ 5 KHz tuning was required.  
<P>
<B> TUNING MODE-B:</B>  VHF down, UHF up. On mode B you must compensate for UPLINK Doppler and it is not easy to
do since you are doing it in the blind.   But remeber it is OPPOSITE.  Start off
DOWN 10 or 5 Khz at the start.  Tune Up 5 KHz as the pass progresses.  Mode B
satellites (SUNSAT and PCSAT) should be designed with WIDE receivers so that only 
2 steps are needed. +5 and -5 KHz.  (The center is so brief as to not be worth tuning).

<P>
<B> EFFECTIVENESS:</B> The APRStk screen shot below shows the ANALYZE command which
plots the packet count over time (in red) along with the Elevation Angle
(in green).  This is useful to compare the relative performance of your station.  
Notice how KO23 has just completed a pass and the packets began being
received on my 20" 3/4 wave Omni at about 30 degrees and then it was received
all the way down to about 20 degrees.  The 5 evenly spaced spikes are local TNC reset data
that occurs every time the THD7 is commanded to QSY down 5 Khz.  Two other spikes are
spurious re-tunes and the big one, I caused by QSYing the radio to 144.39 for a few
seconds before I realized I wanted to save this plot.  These peaks are not
packets from the satellite.  The TMD700 does not generate this extra data,
 since it does not reset the TNC everytime you send a QSY command.

<B>FUTURE:</B>  This ASTARS concept has been approved for operation via many satellties
over the years such as AO16, LO19, IO26, SO35, OPAL, SAREX, PCsat1 & 2, Sapphire, ANDE, RAFT
 and ARISS and all others operating on the unidvewal APRS satelite channel of 145.825 MHz.
There is no reason why it cannot be supported on all digital amateur satellite
missions once the primary mission or science objectives have been met.  
We encourage experimentation and consideration for future applications.
