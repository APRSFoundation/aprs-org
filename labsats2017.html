<B>LABsats:</B> These labsats shown here have been used since about 2010 and are based on the <A HREF="http://byonics.com/mtt4b"><B>Byonics.com MTT4B</B></A> 1200 baud VHF Microtracker packet transceiver and an Arduino prototyping board to give students in the US Naval Academy's Aerospace labs
various hands-on experiments with satellite technology at low cost.  The photo above
shows deputy NASA Administrator Admiral Steidle being briefed on the LABsat
system.  We use the LABsats to support about 33 lab periods covering
a number of space design principles in our sophomore intro labs (EA204) and in our senior
spacecraft design labs (EA467).
<P>
<B>Flight Units:</B> The full size MTT4B transceiver above will not fit a cubesat, so we have 
also laid out the board to fit a cubesat-104 size bus.  We call this board the
<A HREF="satt4.html"><B>SATT4</B></A> and it uses a kit of the special parts from Byonics mounted on our ExpressPCB circuit board.  The link has the full design.  We have at least 6 spacecraft in space or manifest or in work that use this design. 
See <A HREF="psat2.html"><B>PSAT2</B></A> for an example and links to the other spacecraft.
<P>

<B>Live Downlinks:</B> Also when using this LABSAT or PSAT comms board, any packets heard anywhere in the world by IGates will make it to the live APRS satellite downlink web pages:

<B>Telemetry Command and Control:</B> The basis for these Labsats is the same Amateur Radio Command and Control Comms card we use in our cubesats design as shown at right.  Called the
<A hREF="satt4.html"><B>SATT4</B></A> this 3.5" square comms board contains the AX.25 packet radio TNC and the VHF 1.5W RF transceiver.  It also provides the 5 channels of analog telemetry and the potential 8 bits of on/off commanding.  The actual photos of the Labsats show the earlier version of the Byonics MTT4 which is no longer available.  That is why we laid out their newer MTT4B to this new SATT4 board to also use in our Labsats.
<P>

<B> By the end of the semester the 33 labs have then learned everything from power system to comms, sensors to control, and ending in 4 labs on Attitude Dynamics & Control (ADCS) where the labsat is 
hung on  a string where it can be commanded and controlled by the Arduino.  A final demo deploys the satellites on strings around thee campus with their S-band cameras so the students can command the Spysats remotely using the ADCS modes.</B>

<B>LABSAT SYSTEM: </B> 
The LABsat concept was developed at USNA beginning about 1998 to use innexpensive 
off-the shelf components
for under about $600 each ($900 with discrete TX & RX), yet include RF hardware similar
to what we used in our 5 actual spacecraft
(<A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCSAT</B></A>, <B>PCSAT2</B>, <B>ANDE</B>, <B>RAFT</B>, and
<B>MARScom</B>) so that they could actually close
the link from orbit in the Amateur Satellite Service.  
The labsats can not only serve as the final integration of all the
modules of the seniors lab course, but they can also serve as rapid prototyping devices
for testing modules and components for auxilliary payloads and applications.
. With their full space-link budget comms system, they can be carried anywhere on
the academy or out to 500 miles LOS and still be commanded for demos.
Our next satellite project is <B>Psat</B>.

<!-- <A HREF="labsats/Labsat-points.htm"><B>See salient points</B></A>.//-->
<P>

<B>COMM SYSTEM:</B> . The Telemetry, Command and Control system communicates at 1200 baud using the standard AX.25 packet radio protocol
that has flown on MIR, the Shuttle and ISS plus a dozen or more satellites in the
Amateur Satellite Service (including 5 of our own). . The current Labsat model uses
the Byonics.com MTT4 series of Microtrackers for the Telemetry, command and control and
an Ardunio for controll and programming.

<P>

<IMG SRC="labs/room-to-room-link-test-RX.png" height=200 width=400>
<P>
<IMG SRC="labs/link-1mi-testX.jpg" align=right>

<B>Room-to-Room Link Test:</B> While this is not an actual lab, it is an essential test
we require on all student satellite comm system projects.  There is no such thing as a viable bench-top
comm test with any value.  The transmitter emitts 100,000,000,000,000 or a 100 million*million times
more RF power than the receiver needs for a good link.  It is impossible to get that separation on a desk top.  So, our first level test is to put the transmtter in a faraday cage (an old metalic PC box)
and include about 60 dB of attenuation in the cable plus ferrite chokes on all leads going into
or out of the box (data or power).  Then we place the TX box (above left) hundreds of feet away in another room
and connect back to the receiver under-test (above right) via 200' of lossy RG-58 cable with 20 or 30 dB
attenuators in the middle.  Then the cable connects to a step attenuator at the receiver for making weak signal link tests.  The huge physical separation makes sure there is no leakage around all the attenuators.
<P>


<B>1 Mile Link Test:</B> The final test of any  flight units is the 1 mile full range test as shown at right.  The satellite and ground station are separated by about a mile and then 30 dB of attenuators are placed in the ground station coax line and in the distant satellite test item.  This total attenuation summs to 60 dB which is the same thing as a range difference of 1000-to-1.  If the communications works with this
attenuation over 1 mile, then it proves it will work over 1000 miles without the attenuation.
<P>
An advantage of this test is that it permits full test of the antennas as well.  Also, if there is true line-of-sight then the test should be pretty reliable except for ground-reflection gains and nulls.  But these can be quickly assessed by raising and lowering the test antennas and looking for the peak and avoiding the null.  You can assume the peak is no more than about a 3 dB ground gain,
though the nulls can be 10 dB or moer deep.
<P>

<IMG SRC="labsats/dish-TV-sband1x.JPG" align=right height=200 width=200>

<BR>
<B>IMAGING SYSTEM:</B> All of the LABsats have a low cost ($75) camera on board 
operating on the four video carriers at either
1200 or 2400 MHz, for a total of 8 independent LABsat images. . 
These 
<A HREF="labsats/SPY-systemLband.JPG"><B>self-contained cameras </B></A> 
not only make excellent imaging devices, but their
operation at L and S band make great microwave link sources and receivers for
antenna and link labs below. . Normally the cameras operate in the lab 
with their OMNI antennas,  but 4 mile range is easily achievable outside
using the parabolic reflector on the LABsat as shown to the
left and an 18" dish at the receiver as shown to the right.  .
This is a challenge for the ADCS when the satellite is so far away
that the students have to use telmetry to determine and then command the
attitude in the blind to point it back to the ground station before they can
even see the image!.

<P>

<B>STACKsats:</B> The images below show two of the typical 2005 style LABsat stack configurations.  These
show the original momentum wheel and magnetorquing experiments for demonstrating attitude 
control.
The Motor and the orthogonal X and Y torquing coils demonstrate
actual attitude control using the Earths magnetic field.  When hung from a string,
students are able to change the attitude of the labsat, and, with the right pulsing
of the coils, spin up or de-spin the spacecraft. . Other models can demonstrate
propulsion with either Match-heads, Estes rockets, or Fans. [We now use fans after too many fire-alarms]...

<P>
<B>FLATsats:</B> 
As shown in the 8 different models below, the LABsats can also be configured into a 
FLATsat configuration for the EPS Solar Panel System design Lab.  In the FLATsat 
configuration, three Solar Panel sides of the
spacecraft can be illuminated at once as is the typical illumination of a
cube shaped satellite.  During the design Lab, we have boxes of 8 different
solar cell sub-panels of various voltages and currents.  The students must
design a power system that can be illuminated under a lamp which will power
their LABsat including momentum wheel, while staying within the panel size 
allocated.  Cost is also a parameter of the overall design challenge.

<P>
<B>ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS: </B> 
The original 2005 Labsatw were composed of several boards.  The image below shows three of the LABsat 
boards (the RF Transceiver board, a Solar Panel, and the Comand/Control/Telemetry
board).  The single radio transceiver board was replaced with separate TX and
RX boards in 2005 so students could perform individual functionsl tests on these
modules. Other standard boards are the Battery
board, and experimental prototype board.  The photo on the right shows how the Telemety
and Transceiver boards are used to make measurements during the Solar Power lab.
<BR>

<IMG SRC="labsats/Labsat-Solar1x.JPG" height = 240 width = 320>
<P>
The drawing below shows how the LABsat telemetry system is typically used as a
data collection device during experiments.  In this case the 4 of the channels are being
used to collect Solar Panel voltage and temperature, plus current and battery voltage 
and discharge current of the torque motor.  This same 5 channel telemetry of the original Kantronics KPC-3 packet TNC is also now in the Byonics MTT4B that we now use.

<P>
<IMG SRC="labsats/EPStempMotor.GIF">
<P>
<B>TRANSMITTERS:</B>  New in 2005 labs, the original $100 radio transceiver was replaced
with discrete TX and RX panels (at $200 each raising satellite costs to about $900 each) 
so that  students could measure and 
peak the transmitter for peak power out and measure the antenna SWR.  They also
observe and measure any harmonics or other spurious emissions.  These emissions
are important in passing EMI testing.  This experiment also has them plot the
temperature rise of the transmitter final PA amplifier so they learn the heat
involved in a 2W transmitter and how it is mostly concentrated in the final stage
and requires thermal design to get rid of it. . They use a FLIR camera to see
the temerature of the components (mostly the driver and PA).  We still use these discrete transmitters and receivers since the on in the current LABSAT is not much bigger than a large postage stamp!

 <IMG SRC="labsats/TXdwg.GIF">

<P>
<B>RECEIVERS:</B> On the new discrete receiver, students measure
the 10 dB SNR sensitivity and bandwidth as shown below.  They measure the
noise power on the audio voltmeter and then increase the signal until they
achieve 10dB, and then 20 dB SNR.  They then move the signal up and down
in frequency to measure the 6 dB bandwidth of the receiver.  SImilarly, we still  use these discrete receivers so the students can actually see the individual stages on the board.

<B>STACK INTEGRATION:</B>
The next close up view shows how we stacked the original 6"x6" boards back in 2005 to compose a LABsat.  The right image is the Kantronics KPC3 we used to use. By having a common footprint, the
students have greater freedom in the physical layout of their designs.  In
the attitude control lab, they have to arrange for a good center of gravity and
calculate their moment of inertia.  This view, from top down is composed of:

<LI>Payload board:  . . . . The top board is the torgue coil control board
<LI>Transceiver Board: . The XCVR board is being replaced with separate TX & RX boards
<LI>TNC board: . . . . . .  The TNC board has the Command, Control, Telemetry board (shown separately to the right)

<P>
<B>TELEMETRY:</B> The block diagram of the original 5 channel Telemetry Command and control interface for the original Kantronics KPC-3plus TNC is shown below.  Now in the MTT4B (and our SATT4) we have
the same 5 analog inputs but also eight command bit outputs instead of the original two (A & B). 
The bidirectional serial bus allows unlimited expansion to other processors
and experiments.  This Amateur Radio Packet TNC functionality is the foundation of most of the labsat
experiments.  It is identical to the dozen currently flown or manefest on USNA satellites.
<P>
<IMG SRC="labsats/tlm-tnc-ctrl.GIF" >
<P>
To prepare the COTS Kantronics TNC packet modem back in 2005 for use as a Telemetry, Command and Control system,
we make modifications to the circuitry and make various taps off of many of the
microprocessor I/O lines.  With these mods, the students can easily access the
CPU telemetry inputs and command outputs.  
<A HREF="labsats/LABSATtncMods1006.GIF">See details of the TNC mods</A>.
<P>
LABsat telemetry consists of periodic packets containing a serial number followed by
5 comma delimited analog values in the range of 0 to 255. 
<A HREF="labsats/LS1-1001.TXT"><B> (see example)</B></A>.  This file can be opened directly into
EXCEL for display and/or conversion to specific units for display.  If more than one
LABsat is on the air, then the separate labsat callsign packets need to be sorted first.

<P>
<B>SIGNALS AND MODULATION:</B>
<P>
<B>FDMA and BPSK:</B> The students use the Transmitters and Receivers and Telemetry system to investigate
both FDMA and TDMA systems.  To observe and FDMA system, we simply load DIGIPAN PSK31 Amateur radio software on every PC in the lab and then crossconnect the sound card audio from an HF receiver to every PC's LINE-IN so they can all see the same waterfall of whatever we can find on the HF PSK31 frequency of 14.070 MHz.  But then we also patch the PSK31 transmit audio output from every PC via a 10k resistor to that same common audio point.  This way any PC can also be used to trnamit intot he same waterfall. (Not on the air to the HF radio, but their TX tones just superimpose onto the same waterfall).

<P>
<B>TDMA and FSK Data:</B> We tap in a dual channel O'scope to see the reecived audio and discriminator detector as shown on the right. They observe and capture time domain waveforms and
compare signals and compare the dualtone AFSK to the recovered bits and to the receoverd ASCII telemetry as shown on the right.  We still  use the original KPC3 TNC to get the tap point on the data bit recovery point in the circuit.

<P>
<B>LABSAT GROUND STATIONS:</B> The ground station for both our LABsats and our
USNA Satellites on orbit consists of a brief-case system containing a laptop, 
and AX.25 packet radio modem and small radio.  The one shown below uses the Kenwood
TH-D7 packet radio that has built-in TNC-modem for easy construction and is 
suitable for actual comms with the spacecraft on orbit and in the lab.  On the right
is a GSE laptop connected to our flight RAFT and MARScom satellites.

<P>
<B>ATTITUDE CONTROL LABS:</B> The below images were our labsats in about 2005 showing the reaction wheel and torque coil labs.  The initial approach shown
above right used <i>match-head</i> thrusters, but having a room full of students and boxes
of matches is a bad mix. The next thruster design used Estes two rocket engines on outriggers on a very massive plate (the large mass to keep it under control). But during the
third year, the labsat flew off the support string and crashed and burned. . The newer LABSAT we developed in 2008 and still use is an excellent final design that uses small CPU fans as thrusters.
<P>

The image shows the original foam sat aligned with North (using the small permanent 
magnet inserted on the +X face).  The match-head Thruster was inserted on the lower left
-Y face and ignited.  The moment of inertia is calculated and the resulting
angular velocity is used to calculate the force of the thruster.  The dip needle 
shows the orientation of the Earths Magnetic field in the lab.

<P>
In 2006 we abandoned the match-motor tiny thrusters for the much more vigorous
ESTES rocket motor on an actual LABsat as shown above.  This satellite 
was hung outdoors but close
to the lab window so it is easy to see.  First the CW motor was fired to give the
satellite a good spin CW.  Then the CCW motor was fired and if they were close in
performance, then the second motor would counteract the spin and return the satellite
to rest in about 1 second. . With lots of smoke and fire of course.
<P>
<B>Magnetic Stabilization:</B> To help studnets visualize the attitudes of
spacecraft with magnetic stabilization, I wrote a program in Qbasic to generate many
views from our ground station such as the one below. This one shows that
fixed magentic stabilization gives horizontal attitude to the south of us,
becoming more vertical the further north.  But perfectlyl predictible and
reproducable on every pass.

<P>
<IMG SRC="labsats/MAG30w.gif">

<P>
<B>SERIAL DATA COMMUNICATIONS EXPERIMENT:</B>  In this lab (called Telemetry II above), the students
analyze the serial data output of a GPS unit and connect it to the LABsat 
command/control system to transmit GPS position data to the ground station in APRS format.  
Back in 2005, the data is then decoded and
displayed on a local map of the Academy.  Each GPS (since the experiment is conducted
indoors) is pre-loaded with a simulated position.  The screen shot below
of the <A HREF="index.html"><B>APRS</B></A> display 
shows the positions reported by their GPS units and the callsigns
the students gave their labsats for this experiment.  The students are required to
manually parse the data fields and then this display gives them feedback about 
their successful data transmission.
<P>

<B>Now since 2008,</B> we simply transmit this data on the national APRS frequency of
144.39 MHz and it will be picked up by a local APRS Igate and fed into the global APRS
Internet system where the students (and anyone else) can zoom in on
<A HREF="http://aprs.fi"><B> APRS.FI</B></A> and see their plots live.

<B>OTHER Experiments:</B> Another advantage of the LABsat based experience for the
students is that they can use it as the baseline for building and testing other
sub components of their EA-470 satellite design work.  In the photo below, a
FLATsat model was used to test a string-cutter antenna deployment design for
one of the early RAFT models.  In this case, the students could concentrate on
the mechanical and structural details and simply use the FLATsat as the control
system.  On the right, students experiment with a UHF helix antenna.

<B>SATELLITE TRACKING:</B> The USNA Satellite Lab maintains a track on all of our
own satellites plus other university and interesting satellites.  When passes occur
during labs, students participate in ground station operations.  In a number of
experiments, the students have done the planning and scheduling of PCSAT2
and PCSAT1 commanding.

The image below is used to help the students visualize the daily pass geometry of
PCSAT2 over our station.

<B>FLIGHT HERITAGE:</B>
The LABsat hardware is derived from the actual flight hardware used on several 
of the successful Naval Academy Satellite designs that have flown or are currently 
manafest.  These systems are similar and compatible to what has flown on the MIR, 
ISS and the Space Shuttle for use by schools and universities around the world.
By using a common Telemetry Command and Control system, the independent 
flight systems can actually be used in constellation with each other for
multiple satellite experiments.  Also, their commonality encourage colaboration
with other schools making similar compatible systems.

<B>USNA SATELLITES: </B>  A total of eight independent Telemetry Command and Control
Systems similar to our labsats have flown or have been delivered for flight as
of 2007 as shown below.  Both PCsat, PCSAT2 and ANDE are dual systems, meaning they carry
two complete systems each.  The dual systems give redundancy, and also give
multiple functionality.  The RAFT and MARScom systems have single TC&C systems.

<B>Dry Spell:</B> Then we had no launch opportuinities for 7 years until we got a ride
for <A HREF="psat.html"><B>PSAT</B></A> in May 2015 and several more manifest for launch in 2017 and 2018 such as 
<A HREF="qikcom-1.html"><B>QIKCOM-1</B></A> currently on ISS awaiting deployment,

<A HREF="qikcom-2.html"><B>QIKCOM-2</B></A> currently on a PSLV awaiting launch this Fall,

<A HREF="psat2.html"><B>PSAT2</B></A> Manifest for Spring 2018 on STP-2 mission, and

<A HREF="hfsat.html"><B>HFSAT</B></A> currently removed from any DoD launch because it is Amateur and the AirForce has declaired it will not launch any more USNA AMateur Student project satellites.
