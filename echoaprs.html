<B>ECHO's POTENTIAL for DIGIPEATING:</B>  ECHO is ideal for supporting global 
HAM radio handheld and mobile digital
communications at 9600 baud.  We have demonstrated this capability via many previous 
<A HREF="astars.html">satellites</A>, 
but now the new ECHO and the thousands of handheld digital
radios in the hands of AMSAT members can make this become a permanent reality.  The table
below lists the installed capability of the Kenwood D7 and D700 handheld
and mobile APRS radios for stand-alone satellite communications.  These radios include
not only the self-contained 9600 baud TNC, but also an APRS processor and display
system so that
digital communications can be entered from the keypad and displayed on the multi-line 
display and even the map of an attached GPS.  All without any other connections or PC's
or laptops:

<B>External Message Keyboard for the D700:</B>  And you don't even have to use the
DTMF pad to enter messages.  There is an interface to a standard PS-2
type keyboard that makes it easy to send messages from the D700 that just plugs
into the Mic jack:
<A HREF="http://www.coastalchip.com/Kenkey.htm"><B>D700 Keyboard (PS2) interface</B></A>.
<P>
Thousands of HAMS and many AMSAT members have these digital <i>Satellite-Communicators</i> capable radios already.  
Lets USE them!
<P>
<B>PRESENT SITUATION:</B>  Recently (July 2006) ECHO has enabled the Packet Digipeater
for 9600 baud.  You can do this easily with a D7 or D700 APRS radio.
The APRS uplink is on 145.86 and the downlink is 435.150 +/- 10 KHz doppler.
Set your TNC baud rate to 9600 and set the PATH to go VIA PACB-1.  Notice that the
current downlink is almost 17 dB worse than the PCSAT downlink and almost 24 dB
less than the ISS packet system.  This is beacause the downlink is running at
only 0.3W for power conservation, and using UHF instead of 2m to omni antennas
suffers an additional 9 dB loss.  But getting UP into ECHO is identical to getting
into the other birds.

<!--
There has been a problem on ECHO with too many interrupts from
the uplink packet receiver.  But this was drastically reduced and the problem solved by
restricting packets to only packets that begin with the letter "P".  This eliminates over
99% of the false interrupts.  <A HREF="echo/echoUI.txt"><B>See description</B></A>.  But all
APRS packets normally use the destination address of APxxxx, so at first blush this appears
to prevent the use of ECHO for APRS communications.  But this is not the case.
<P>

<B>THE APRS FIX:</B> UI packets including APRS packets can begin the destination address with any character they 
want.  I suggest PECHO as a good address.  In APRS, this is called an "ALTNET".  
Just set an ALTNET or "unproto" destination
address of PECHO and it should work fine for APRS messages, but not for position data.
To get POSITIONS through ECHO, users will need to enter a LAT/LONG DEGREES of 00 and
000 and enter their LAT/LONG degrees in the minutes field.  Thus, 38 deg 59 min North
is entered as 00 deg 38.59 North. This position is good to the nearest mile and should
be fine enough for satelite communications.  THis works, because positions begining
with 00 latitude are transmtted also with a leading "P" in the packet.
//-->

<P>
<B>ECHO CONFIGURATION:</B> We hope that ECHO can support this live 
user-to-user communications whenever the digital BBS is on, even while other modes
are in use
because of its multiple receivers and 2 independent transmit streams.  
This UI digipeating mode in support of mobile 
and handheld users shares one of the receivers with the PACSAT file sharing system.
This does not compete with the popular FM voice transponder.
To help ECHO format it's STATUS packets for visibility on these mobile radios,
here is a

purposes, here was the original
<A HREF="echo/echo-ops.txt"> <B> pre-launch APRS proposal </B></A>.
<P>
<IMG SRC="echo/echoblock.gif">
<P>
<B>ACTIVATION:</B> You can monitor the ECHO (AO-51) downlink at anytime with your
APRS system or D7 and D700 radios (and a beam).  Ocasionally, you will see the 
spacecraft's STATUS packet that looks something like this:
<P>

If d:1 then digipeating is enabled, if d:0 then it is disabled.

<A NAME="astars">
<A HREF="astars.html"><B>ASTARS</B></A> is an Amateur Radio Mobile Tracking and Communications 
System for Reporting position, status, and messages to and from Handhelds and Mobiles
in distant locations via Amateur Satellites using off-the-shelf amateur equipment as shown
above or <A HREF="D7xx/W4HFZ-mobile.JPG"> See W4HFZ's Installation</A>.   Many AMSAT satellties have
supported this mission and our objective is to encourage more transponders and to even
operate more of them on the same frequency to improve satellite access times for the users.
Since APRS uses digipeaters generically using generic digipeater aliases, the users dont 
have to configure for each different digipeater.  Whatever is in view, will support their
packets.  One bird gives about 6 passes a day access.  Two birds would double this, yet
the separate satellites would be transparent to the user.  This concept was tested using
PCsat and ISS and it worked beautifully. 
See <A HREF="pcsat/isstestsum.txt"> <B> the test summary </B></A> or the full story and
images on the <A HREF="pcsat.html"> <B> PCsat</B></A> web page.  
There is much history on the use of ASTARS via AMSATS as noted below:

<P>
<B>1200 Baud PSK ASTARS</B> was used on AO-16 and IO-26 <A HREF="astars.html"> [See history]</A>
<BR>
<B>1200 Baud AFSK ASTARS</B> was and is used on MIR, SAREX, ARISS, SunSat, PCsat, PCSAT2
and ANDE. <A HREF="astars.html"> [See history]</A>
<BR>
<B> 9600 BAUD ASTARS</B> was used via UO-22 and PCsat, and now could be used via ECHO!
<P>
<B> Handheld digital communications </B> became a reality when Kenwood
introduced the 1200/9600 baud APRS data mobile radio, the 
<A HREF="D7xx/TM-D700A.gif">TM-D700A</A> and the TH-D7(G) Handheld.  
These dual band data radios with built-in TNC's and front 
panel APRS displays make it possible to send and receive the very 
short APRS style comunications via any 9600 Baud PACSAT if digipeat
is enabled (such as UO-22 and now ECHO). Thus, 
these two radios are off-the-shelf satellite data terminals ready for 
ASTARS and they need NO PC or other accessory.  They can send and receive
all data on the radio front panel with only the proper mobile whip antenna! (see below).
<P>
<B>INTERNET LINKED DOWNLINK STATIONS(SatGates):</B>
The presence of the Internet makes possible the linking
together of multiple disparate downlink sites all over the world to yield a tremendous
gain in reliability through space and time diversity reception.  These
 SAT-Gates combine all packets heard
into the existing worldwide APRS infrastructure for delivery
to any compatible APRS station in the network.   
<P>
<IMG SRC="astars/SatGates.jpg">
<P>
This WEB PAGE describes how ECHO can be used to bring Amateur Radio into the
<i>SATPHONE</i> generation, beginning with its Limitations, 
expected Operations scenario, the TMD700 and THD7  set up for mobile operation, 
Linking traffic to/from the worldwide APRServe system via SAT-Gates, 
how the SAT-Gates operate, and how the terrestrial APRS system can 
distribute satellite access times to the mobiles using minimum 
bandwidth on the terrestrial system.  The cartoon below shows how any APRS
satellite contributes to the Global Real-Time connectivity for End-to-End
message capabiility anywhere on the planet.  Any packet launched anywhere,
can go anywhere, and the sender needs NO PATH INTELLIGENCE.  Every packet goes
INTO the internet linked system.  But it only comes back to RF if the recepient
has been seen by an IGate in its local area.  The format is AX.25 Packet
throughout, even while transiting the internet links...  THINK CELLULAR but
using AX.25 packet.
<P>
<IMG SRC="echo/GlobalAPRS.gif">
<P>
<B>USER DATA BURSTS:</B>  The APRS Mic-E format used by the Kenwood radios transmits
all of the following information in only a fraction of a second at 9600 baud.
The Mic-E protocol is highly efficient and only needs 9 bytes plus the
STATUS text bytes in the data part of the packet.  Thus, hundreds of users per pass
can send a lot of information via ECHO while sharing the transponder equitably.
<P>
<IMG SRC="astars/mic-etbl.jpg">

<A NAME="SAT MODES"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="APRS MESSAGES"></A>

<B>APRS MESSAGES:</B>  In addition to the above position and status information,
these radios can send APRS text messages and Email.   For new 
satellite operators unfamiliar with APRS messages,
 it should be understood that an APRS message is a single LINE of text.  Most 
messages stand alone, but are occassionaly strung together if it wont fit on
one line.  See a <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/Dsc00007.jpg">photo of a 15 byte message</A>
 received on the TMD700 radio.  (The maximum length is 64 bytes).

<P><B>APRS EMAIL:</B>  Simillarly, any APRS operator can initiate 
an EMAIL message from his HT or mobile radio.  Just like other APRS messages, it
is also only ONE LINE and the one line INCLUDES the
full email address.  This forces brevity!  Here is an Email I transmitted from 
my D700 mobile enroute to work one day.  Notice that the SINGLE packet 
entered into the D700 was simply:
<LI>TO:EMAIL :wb4apr@amsat.org Testing Email via pacsat from my van enroute to work.
<P>
Yet, here is how it was received by my Email system after being SAT-Gated to APRServe
and from there, picked up by the EMAIL Engine at WU2Z's and shipped out as regular Email:
<P>
<IMG SRC="D7xx/email.jpg">
<P>
 
<B>OPERATIONS SCENARIO:</B>  Operations is simple.  If your radio is set to 9600 baud
and tuned to the ECHO downlink, your HT will receive ANY messages directed to it via
the satellite.  It will also receive bulletins and status from the satellite and other
users.  Similarly you can send messages including one-line Emails by uplinking to the
satellite.  To encourage a common and consistent operations procedure, the following 
is recommended:

<LI>  Set your SSID to -3 so SAT-Gates know
      what Traffic to route to you.

<LI>  Your objective is to uplink at least ONE successful posit packet per pass.  
      Setting to a one packet per minute rate.

<LI>  SAT-Gates will only return traffic to you when the satellite
      is above 10 deg to you.  (it knows where you are...)

<LI>  Signal the SATGate to try lower angles with "QRZ" in your STATUS, 
      or by sending CUSTOM MSG 3 if you have a good view to the horizon.

<P>
<B>SAT-GATE OPERATIONS:</B>  See the details in the original ASTARS web
page about how to set up a special ECHO SAT-GATE...  The key to the very
high success rate of using ASTARS via LEO satellites such as ECHO are
because unlike previous amateur satellite activity, we can combine the
outputs from any number of omni antenna satgates nationwide and the result 
is over a 99.96%
 chance of capturing every packet over the USA!
<P> 

<IMG SRC="astars/stns.gif">
<P>
This map shows how 6 ground stations or more using only omni antennas were needed to 
give reliable coverage for the lower powered PACSATS.  But with ECHO, only a few
satgates will be needed to fully link the ECHO ASTARS mission to the existing 
global APRS internet linked system of groundstations.  Any station with a whip
antenna, a Kenwood or Alinco 9600 baud TNC/Radio with a PC and full time internet 
access can be a satgate!  If their radio is a D700 or D7, then software can
also autocompensate for Doppler and auto-tune to other ASTARS satellites when
they come into view! <B> NEWS! APRStk (see below) now AUTO
TUNES for any satellite in view!</B>
<P>
<P>
<B>SATELLITE TRACKING AND PASS PREDICTIONS:</B>  APRS mobiles should only uplink during the
actual satellite pass to keep the uplink clear
 of non-essential transmissions.  To this end, we have two very good methods:

<LI> <B>Tracking Software:</B>  I have added Satellite tracking to APRSdos in the form
of APRStk.exe.  It presents the satellite predictions on the APRS map
and will auto-tune the Kenwood radios including doppler.  It will also rotate any 24V AC
cheap TV rotator towards each satellite for maximum singal. Great as a shack or office
monitor so you never miss a pass.  

It must be run within an already installed APRSdos file structure. See download info
below.  The screen shot
below shows how it tracks both APRS stations, and satellites and gives a 2 hour
pass prediction across the bottom letting you know what is coming up...

<P><IMG SRC="aprsdata-tk/aprstk0.gif"> 

<LI><B>APRS Bulletins and Objects:</B>
Another program, APRSdata is a service that runs on someone's station in your region, 
and it will update
the front panel of all Kenwood Radios with the azimuth and distance to any satellites in
view and also send out every 10 minutes a schedule of the next
80 minute pass predictions.  It does this by transmitting the satellites as APRS moving
objects on the terrestrial APRS network  (144.39) and by sending the schedule as a 
DX spot to the DX-LIST in the radios.  THis way, no one needs a 
tracking program, they will receive it live over the air on their radio front panel.

<P>   Using APRStk in this manner to alert everyone on the APRS frequency including
mobiles and handhelds to satellites inview can be thought of almost as a "WEB"
server to your radio's front panel.  The 10 minute schedule is transmitted to the
radio's  DX-LIST.  Thus, our mobile satellite users 
can get the PASS info they need without lugging along a laptop.
This shows you what the Handheld THD7 HT will capture and display
about the satellites.  First is the DX-SPOT list showing that there are three satellites
UO22, AO27 and UO14 coming up in the next 80 minutes and when.

<P>
The next two screens show when the satellite is in view.  They show the Range, Azimuth
Uplink and Downlink Frequencies, Doppler and distance to the satellite.  Just perfect for aiming your handheld
antenna.  For more details see <A HREF="satinfo.html">APRS Satellite Resources</A>.

If you already have APRSdos, download either 
<A HREF="ftp://tapr.org/aprssig/dosstuff/APRSdos/astk-exe.zip">APRStk</A> or
<A HREF="ftp://tapr.org/aprssig/dosstuff/APRSdos/adat-exe.zip">APRSdata</A>.
If you dont already have APRSdos installed, then download

<A HREF="ftp://tapr.org/aprssig/dosstuff/APRSdos/aprs848.zip">APRS848</A> too 
and install it first with PKUNZIP -d or WinZIP.

<P>
<B>TM-D700 and TH-D7(G) SETTINGS:</B>
Here is a list of my minimum setups for the new Kenwood TM-D700 data mobile and TH-D7(G)data
handheld for front-panel-to-Satellite mobile communications via a digipeating
PACSAT in Mode-J or Mode-B:
<P>
<IMG SRC="D7xx/d700setups.jpg">
<BR> 
See also the general purpose <A HREF="D7xx/d700-faq.txt"> <B> set-ups for using the TM-D700</B></A>
radio on conventional APRS mobile applications.
 
<P> 
<B>TRANSMITTING:</B>  Notice, the new D7(G) has the DCD SENSE command so that
the TNC will operate full duplex in APRS mode.  BUT, In APRS mode, the D700 
does not have this ability to set the internal TNC to FULLDUPLEX. THus, while 
your D700 mobile receive BAND is receiveing data the 
radio will not transmit.  Understanding this problem will 
be your key to success.  If the Satellite has periodic quiet times on the
downlink (SUNSAT) then operate normally.  It will get a chance to key up.
But if the downlink is 100% in use
as is normal for UO-22 and all the other PACSATS, then
here are some ways to force a transmit:

<LI> Set to AUTO and then QSY occasionally the downlink long enough to silence rcvr
<LI> Set to PTT and kerchunk xmtr when Posit BECN is ready... (won't do msgs)
<LI> Set to auto and tune RX elsewhere to ignore downlink.  
<LI> Operate PACKET mode with laptop doing APRS (With FULLDUP ON)
<P>
<B>D700 EASY REMOTE CONTROL SATSTATION:</B>
Further, using the remote 
control capability of these radios makes it possible to operate a complete
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/rotator1_files/portor.jpg"> automatic tracking/tuning rotator controlled suit-case portable system </A>
that can be operated
over any length of 8 conductor wire (no coax needed!).  Great for demos, or vacation operating from
your motel room.  See also the <A HREF="rotator1.html"> Rotator interface</A>

<P>
<B>ANTENNAS:</B> With the 8 Watt Echo, ANY UHF or dual band mobile antenna should work
perfectly.  Even though commercial dual-band antennas put all the gain on the horizon and
have minimum high elevation gain, the higher power of ECHO and the fact that it is closer
when it is higher will assure good coverage horizon to horizon.
Because of the short coax run in a car, and no need for a PREAMP, 
a simple vertical WHIP antenna in the center of your car roof is an ideal mobile 
OMNI antenna for both VHF and UHF satellites.  
<P>
With previous satellites, however, this whip
should have been a simple 19" whip which would have acted as a
an 7+ dB 3/4 wavelength whip on UHF (yellow plot below)
to get the gain needed to hear the weak UHF downlinks.
This same whip also worked perfectly on the VHF birds. 
  My D700 would capture packets when the older PACSATS such as UO22
 were above 25 to 30 degrees for a few minutes, but
with the 8 Watt ECHO downlink, horizon
to horizon coverage should be possible on most passes.  
  Here is a plot of the
EZ-NEC produced gains of three whip antennas including the path loss due to range.
My 3/4 wavelength antenna picks up the sats at about 20 deg.  Better than shown here.
<P><IMG SRC="astars/gainplot.gif">
<P>To validate the data for the 3/4 wave vertical, I built a 1575 MHz scale model of
the antenna AND car roof and connected it to a GPS receiver and my SIGPLOT.BAS program.
Letting it run all night, gives an all-sky GAIN PLOT using the satellite signal
strengths as the RF source.  Thus, over time, you get known RF from all angles and all
azimuths and the SIGPLOT program produces a real-world plot of actual antenna pattern
as shown below.  I did it twice, the Green is the 3/4 and Red is the 1/4 wave.  
Notice the high angle gain of the 3/4 at all angles above about 25 deg.  
Although the 1/4 is better down to about 10 degrees, the 6 dB greater path loss
due to the greater distance to the satellite (and trees and buildings) cancels
any advantage here for the weak PACSAT downlinks.
The car roof I modeled was the size of a compact sedan. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="astars/g34-14.jpg" >
<P>
<B> TUNING for ECHO:</B>  Doppler tuning the UHF downlink is trivial to do by ear.  Although
 9600 baud data sounds
 just like open-squelch noise, it does have a "quality" to it that can easily
be heard by ear when the receiver is not centered in the data bandwidth.  All
passes begin at +10 KHz and move down in 5 KHz increments down to -10 KHz. It only
takes a fraction of a second to test QSY to hear if it is time to tune or not.  
Eventually you can hear when it is time...  For omni antennas where you wont 
hear the satellite on the distant horizon, then start at +5 and move twice to -5
during the brief pass. 
<P>

<P>
<B> 9600 BAUD DOWNLINK EFFECTIVENESS:</B> The APRStk screen shot below 
plots the packet count over time (in red) along with the Elevation Angle
(in green) for a 35 degree pass of KO-23 as received on a vertical 19" whip antenna
by the Kenwood HT.  ECHO will be many dB better!

not been considered, endorsed, or approved for operation via any 
existing satellite other than AO16, LO19, IO26, SO35, OPAL, SAREX, PCsat, Sapphire
