PROBLEM(0): There is a random problem with KPC3 digis that at some
point hold up and then regurgitate LOTS of packets.  Here is a possible
fix. Kantronics recommends shorting the RTS and CTS pins together 
within my serial cable. (PINS 4/5 on DB25 and PINS 7/8 on DB9).
Shorting the RTS and CTS together prevents the software from holding 
the RTS pin low. If the RTS pin is at low voltage the KPC3+ will 
start buffering and does not get caught back up.

PROBLEM(1):  The 8.2 version digis do not mark a WIDEn-N or SSn-N 
path as used up when they reach zero as they should.  This BREAKS all 
WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1 mobile packets because after the 8.2 digi digipeats 
the first field, then the second field will never get digipeated again.

TEH FIX: is to put WIDE1-1 into a UIDIGI ALIAS so that it will get
digipeated and callsign inserted AND will be marked as used, so that
the second field, the following ...WIDED2-1 will get used.  This 
allows this old version 8.2 digi to be used.  But there is a COST.

THE COST:  But since this first hop did not actually use the true
WIDEn-N algorithm with its powerful dupe suppression algorithm, then 
this digi will not suppress additional copies of this packet that it 
sees from other digis.  In fact, it will digipeat every other copy
from all surrounding digis of their first hops too.  This is bad 
enough for one 8.2 digi in an area, but is a nuclear incident in
areas with lots of 8.2 digis.

WHERE TO USE: So use this fix cautiously and only in aeras where 
there are few digis and where not more than one digi can usually 
hear a mobile.

ALTERNATE FIX:  (NONE) If your version 8.2 digi is in a busy area,
and if there is an IGATE in range, then simply do not apply the fix 
and just let the 8.2 digi digipeat the WIDE1-1 normally recognizing 
that the packet will only be digipeated once by this digi and the 
packet will go no farther.  But it will get to all locals and to 
the IGATE.

REQUIRED BEACON TEXT:  In either case we want the version 8.2 digi
to have the following beacon: We receommend instead of the usual 
10 character "Wn, SSn-N ..." text that you use "NoW1 SSn-N ..." 
instead.  There are two reasons:

- If you do make the fix, then you want to discourage people from
using WIDE1-1 in this area because it creates extra dupes.s

- If you do not make the fix, then this nomenclature warns users
that WIDE1-1 is not supported here and their packet will only go
one hop.

ACTION:  If your KPC-3 version 8.2 is version KPC3-3F427265-8.2
or later you only need to make the TWO command differences than the 
set-up for a version 8.3 or KPC-3+.  That is, add WIDE1-1 to the 
UIDIGI LIST. and change the BEACON to include the "NoW1...".  
Then go to the version 8.3 file for all other setups.  OF COURSE, 
make all the other PATH changes to show APN382 instead of APN383.

------------------------------------------------------------------
The remainder of this file APPLIES only to really old Version 8.2 
ROMS  in old KPC3's (not PLUS+) prior to version KPC3-3F427265-8.2.   

Digipeaters using these early-8.2 ROMs should be sure to set the
APN382 to show they are older TNC's.  This is because of 
a bug in the UITRACE command that requires these old digis to support
WIDEn-N only in the UIFLOOD parameter, not UITRACE as is being done 
under the New-N paradigm.

This special file shows the workarounds to allow these older version 
8.2 ROMs and old plain KPC-3 TNC's to continue to be used while also 
supporting most of the New N benefits.  Later versions of the Version 
8.2 ROM after release xxxx-7265 are OK.  You can tell them apart by 
typing this command:

UITRACE WIDE,30

If it doesn't like the presence of the "30" and says "eh?" then it is 
an old ROM and needs to be set up according to this file.  The main 
anomoly on these earlier 8.2 ROMs was how they handle digipeating:

1) When packets were decremented to n-0, the path was not marked as 
   being used up.  No one ever noticed this before, but it prevented 
   these digis from supporting WIDE1-1 for fill-in digis.  

2) The UITRACE parameter which supported TRACEn-N did not do proper 
   dupe elimination in some of these 8.2 versions (the ones that don't 
   like the UITRACE WIDE,30 command).

The *workarounds* in these early version 8.2 ROMS are to simply add 
WIDE1-1 as an alias in the UIdigi list so that WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1 for 
mobiles can be supported, and to only use UITRACE to support SSn-N.  
There will be some dupes, but they will not be further propogated by 
any other proper New N digi.  Here are the ONLY differences to setting 
up an old 8.2 digi compared to all the widely published information 
on the 8.3 digis:

Version 8.3:
   UIDIGI  ON,   WIDE4-4, WIDE5-5, WIDE6-6, WIDE7-7
   UIFLOOD  SS,30,ID
   UITRACE  WIDE,30

Version 8.2 (early releases) UNIQUE Settings:
   UIDIGI  ON,   WIDE1-1, WIDE6-6, WIDE5-5, WIDE4-4
   UIFLOOD  WIDE,30,ID
   UITRACE  SS

All of the other special New N Paradigm settings for tayloring the 
DIGI's beacon timing and paths and other settings of the 8.3 will 
also apply to these 8.2 versions.

FIRST:  RESET the TNC to factory defaults to get rid of legacy errors.
Then set the proper settings for APRS that are not the TNC defaults.  
Set these as below:

  MYCALL xxxxxx  Set to a geographical name understandable by travelers
  MYNODE xxxx-7  Set up a KA node callsign
  NUMNODES 2  -  SO SYSOP can use KA nodes to SYSOP other digis
  INTERFACE   -  Terminal.  So you can enter the remaining parameters
  HID OFF     -  These packets are of no value to APRS
  CD SOFTWARE -  For the best collision avoidance method
  UIDWAIT OFF -  To not waste time with multiple slots
  TXD 18      -  To shorten the TX delay by 40% from the 300ms default
 

SECOND, eliminate the settings that are detrimental to the network.

1) UIDWAIT should be OFF. (the default).  With it on, your digi is not 
doing the fundamental APRS fratricide that is the primary mechanism for 
suppressing multiple dupes.  All digis that hear the same packet are 
supposed to DIGI it at the SAME time so that all those copies only take
up one additional time slot. (but outward located digs will hear it 
without collision (and continue outward propogation)

2) UIFLOOD should remain WIDE,30,ID  (this is different from other 
digis under the New N Paradigm) but avoids the dupe problem of UITRACE 
in the vesion 8.2 ROM.

3) UITRACE should be SS where SS is your state or SSS ARRL Section
abbreviation.  This will suport SSn-N routing (or SSSn-N if needed
such as WPAn-N for Western PA section, etc)).  Only users in the 
corners or edges of states would normally use this path so that they 
can use larger N's to communiate in their state without QRM'ing 
adjacent states.  SSn-N can also be used with a first hop of WIDE1-1,
SSn-N if needed to help out on the first hop.  It also assures that
the first hop is identified.

3)  Properly set up the DIGI's beacon packet.  There are 5 possible
beacons u sing the BTEXT and four LTEXTS.  Prior to July 09, we used
all 4 LTEXTS for proportional pathing of the DIGI's own info.  Now
we use only 2 of them so that 2 are available along with the BText
for pushign local info such as receommended Voice repeater and
EchoLink and IRLP frequency objects.

This results in a local DIG ID plus these local info objects once 
every 10 minutes simplex direct and only one 2 hop beacons every 
60 minutes.

4)  Your TOCALL in both the UNPROTO and the LTP's should use the 
TOCALL of APN382 where APN identifies it as digipeater firmware.   
The "3" identifies it as a KPC-3 and the "82" identifies it as ROM 
version.  NOTE, Identifying ROM versions is very important!  See the 
APRS list of TOCALL versions for other ROMS identifications of this 
naming convention.

5)  Your UNPROTO path for the BText should only be DIRECT (APN382 
with no VIAs) since it is used for your local BText which should contain 
information  only of *local* value. 

6) LOCAL VOICE REPEATER RECOMMENDATION:  The BTEXT and two available
LTexts should be used to send out local Frequency OBJECTs indicating 
the best local voice repeater and Echolink or IRLP nodes for travelers 
passing through your area.  See: www.aprs.org/localinfo.html

BText: ;146.835-X*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDMM.hhWrT123 R45m Net 9PM Th Mg3rdTh
   or
BText: ;146.835-X*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDMM.hhWrT123 -060 Net 9PM Th Mg3rdTh


Where 146.835-X is the frequency (-X makes it unique)
T123 R45m  - is the Tone (no tenths) and Range in miles
T123 -060  - is the Tone and Offset in 10's of KHz
Net 9Pm Th - is the weekly net time
Mg3rdTh    - is the monthly meeting date (Mtg3rdW also)

BEACON EVERY 10
UNPROTO APN382

This beacon object is sent DIRECT only to indicate on the front panel 
Mobile displays of travelers in the area to alert them to the best 
voice repeater for Travelers or for other APRS operators.  This exact
format has evolved to make the best use of the 10x10 byte windows on 
many front panel displays.  

7)  IMPLEMENT THE New n-N Paradigm changes.

A.  Set UITRACE SS to support your SS State or SSSS ARRL section 
instead of the old TRACEn-N.  SSn-N paths allow people on the edges 
of a state to participate in a statewide (or section wide) net with 
larger values of N than would normally be allowed.  But since the 
geographic area covered by these digis is limited, then the damage for 
large n-N QRM is also limited.

B.  Keep UIFLOOD as WIDE,30,ID to continue support for WIDEn-N.  
Packets through this digi will not be traceable as they will be in 
other New-N-Paradigm digis, but this avoids the dupe problem in the 
UITRACE parameter.  Be sure ID is set.

C.  Remove the obsolete "RELAY", "WIDE", "TRACE", and "SS" aliases 
in the UIDIGI parameter which are obsolete and generate too many dupes. 

D.  Instead use the UIDIGI alias list to support WIDE1-1 first-hops 
for mobiles and to TRAP the larger N's.  Set UIDIGI as follows:

UIDIGI ON, WIDE1-1, WIDE4-4, WIDE5-5, WIDE6-6

These specific aliases for the larger N's will act like traps because 
this digi will digipeat them once and then no farther.  The closer 
you get to a high density area, the smaller N's you should limit.  
In typical WIDE2-2 areas, set UIDIGI to include WIDE3-3,WIDE4-4,
WIDE5-5,WIDE6-6.  Also if you are getting lots of W4-1 packets from a 
distant city that is not trapping 4-4 at the source, you can also trap 
those specifically by adding WIDE4-1 to the UIDIGI alias list.  For 
more on this be sure to see how we did it in Los Angeles, and prevented 
anything above two hops from getting into the Los Angeles Basin.

8) IMPORTANT!  Set up the DIGI POSITION PACKET format to clearly 
inform users what is supported using the CONSISTENT recommendations 
below so that users can see from any digi exactly what the network is 
doing in an area:

a) Always start with the PHGXXXX
b) Then "W2, SSn-N" shows that only 2 hops are receommended in this 
   area.  And it shows what SSn-N path is supported.
c) The overlay character between the LAT/LONG in these old 8.2 digis
   should become an "F" to show that it has been upgraded to the 
   New-N-Paradigm but WIDEN-N support is still in the uiFlood 
   parameter and that packets will not be traceable through this digi.
d) If you feel you must use the altitude /A=001377, please add it at 
   the end, not first.  Since those first 20 bytes are what the D7 
   and D700 users see and the other stuff above is more important.
   In my opinion, Altitude is redundant since the more valuable term
   of height above average terrain is included in PHG.

CONCLUSION:

The best way to set up an APRS digi is to FIRST do a RESET or RESTORE
to FACTORY DEFAULTS to make sure you dont have any bad settings that
have crept into your system.  Then the ONLY commmands  you have to
change are the ones below.  For the BText, I assumed a local Voice
repeater on 146.940 with a PL of 107 that only goes direct.

MYCALL    XXXXXX  (use a local LOATION name understandable by trvlrs)
MYREMOTE  XXXXXX
MYNODE    XXXXXX-7
NUMNODES  2
INTERFACE TERMINAL
RTEXT   (your secret password string)

BText: ;146.835-X*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrT123 R45m Net 9PM Th Mg3rdTh
BEACON E 10     <== every 10 minutes direct
UNPROTO APN382  <== Identifes the KPC-3 ROM and local direct no VIA's

       The first two DIGI LTexts must be identical so the Position 
       Beacon is not always changing and using up the new-posit LOG 
       files on every user's PC...

LTP 1    APN382 VIA WIDE2-2   
LTP 2    APN382 
LTP 3    APN382 
LTP 4    APN382 


UIDIGI ON, WIDE1-1,WIDE4-4,WIDE5-5, WIDE6-6
UITRACE SS           <for your state or ARRL section
UIFLOOD WIDE,30,ID   <Supports WIDEn-N

That's all there is to it.  Note, these are diffferent from the 
recommedations for the newer Version 8.2 and 8.3 and later ROMS.  
But Please  don't diddle with any other parameters.  The defaults for 
those are the  correct settings.  If you dink with them you can only 
make performance worse.  Also please use the consistent abbreviations 
for "Wn, SSn-N" or "Wn, SSSn-N" in the digis beacon and use the proper 
"F" OVERLAY character for these older 8.2 digis.
