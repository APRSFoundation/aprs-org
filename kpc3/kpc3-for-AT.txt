KPC3+ Vers 8.3 to 9.1 Settings for Permanent AT use         2 Jun 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

updated  3 Jul 2014 to put INT TERM in sequence and fix typos in LT
original 2 Jun 2014

For permanent Golden Packet Sites we want the site to be visible, but
not generate so many packets (15 digipeaters is quite a load) that we
cut down on reliability.  The calls are the mountain name and then the
sequence number along the chain.  With Georgia #1 and Maine #15.

For Solar Powered stations, it is OK to have a photocell turning off
the digipeater completely during darkness to save power.


RESTORE the TNC to factory defaults using the RESTORE command

LTP 1    APN383  
LTP 2    APN383  
LTP 3    APN383 via TEMP2-2
LTP 4    APN383 via HOP7-7

UIFLOOD HOP,30,ID 
UITRACE TEMP,30        
UIDUPE 30              <only in 9.1 ROMS>

These settings assure a local (direct) beacon every 10 minutes and 
then a traceable one via TEMP2-2 via the two adjacent digis every
hour and then a long shot HOP7-7 attempt once every 2 hours.

The BTEXT is not used, since it cannot be synchronized with the
other 4 LTexts to get the timing right.

TE 60 can be used if battery telemetry is desired once an hour.
