KPC3+ (PLUS) Version 8.3 Settings (and 9.1) WIDEn-N DIGIs  14 Jun 2021
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 14 Jun 21 Added note about Problem(0) - Log delayed packets
Update 19 Jul 14 Suggests using digi location vs callsign for the name
Update 24 Jul 09 added 2 LTexts for local EchoLink and IRLP objects
Update 16 Nov 08 to clean up some text
Update  2 Sep 08 added KA-node enabling for digi maintenance
Update  8 Nov 07 clarified that "W2" in a digi text means that W2 is
                  the current local recommendation for that area, not
                  necessarily the trap limit.

Update 24 Jan 07 clean up the BText for local repeaters 
Update 18 Oct 05 to include 9.1 ROMS.  

PROBLEM(0): There is a random problem with KPC3 digis that at some
point hold up and then regurgitate LOTS of packets.  Here is a possible
fix. Kantronics recommends shorting the RTS and CTS pins together 
within my serial cable. (PINS 4/5 on DB25 and PINS 7/8 on DB9).
Shorting the RTS and CTS together prevents the software from holding 
the RTS pin low. If the RTS pin is at low voltage the KPC3+ will 
start buffering and does not get caught back up.

This applies to all 8.3 and 9.1 ROMS running on the KPC-3+(PLUS) TNC.
With one small change (noted below), it also applies to KPC-3+ TNC's 
running the last version of the 8.2 ROMS ending in "7265".  The 
difference is noted below in section 4) and "6E".

Typically, all KPC-3+ digis already support the basics of New n-N 
Paradigm, that is, WIDEn-N digipeating.  But there are better ways to 
use these features that have been developed since January 2005 that
includes:

 - add path tracing to WIDEn-N for the health of the network
 - add TRAPPING of large values of N to cut out-of-area-QRM
 - add Proportional-pathing to the digi's beacon to cut QRM
 - added SSn-N path for efficient area-wide routing
 - added standrdized TEXT to let users see capabilities
 - Added new overlay "S" so users could see these new digis

FIRST:  RESET the TNC to factory defaults to start fresh.

1)  Resetting the TNC should remove the obsolete "RELAY", "WIDE", 
"TRACE", and "SS" aliases which are obsolete.  

2)  Set these commands for normal operation:
  MYCALL      -  Digi callsign or preferably LOCATION name
  INTFACE     -  Terminal.  So you can enter the remaining parameters
  HID OFF     -  These packets are of no value to APRS
  CD SOFTWARE -  For the best collision avoidance method
  UIDWAIT OFF -  To speed up the response
  TXD 18      -  To shorten the TX delay by 40% from the 300ms default
  XMITLVL xxx -  Set TX modulation level to less than full distortion! 
  MYA NONE

SECOND:  Set up the KA-Node process so that you can maintain distant
digis via a path from a local digi if you own more than one digi.

   MYNode XXXXXX-7  The KA node callsign
   NUMNodes 2       Will support up to 2 connections

THIRD:  Eliminate the settings that are detrimental to the network.

* UIDWAIT should be OFF. (the default).  With it on, your digi is not 
doing the fundamental APRS fratricide that is the primary mechanism 
for minimizing channel loading.  All digis that hear the same packet 
are supposed to DIGI it at the SAME time so that all those copies 
only take up one additional time slot. (but outward located digs will 
hear it without collision (and continue outward propogation)

FORTH:  Set up the DIGI ALIASES to perform the New-N digipeating.

1) UITRACE WIDE,30  - This tells the digi to support WIDEn-N and to
insert its own callsign so that the path is fully traceable.

2) UIFLOOD SS,30,ID - Where SS or SSS or SSSS is your State or local
ARRL or other Ham radio comunications section organization name.
Notice, that having ID ON is a complete reversal to previous 
recommendations that wanted NOID to be set.  Now we want ID ON to
improve path tracing.  Users of SSn-N paths are encouraged to use 
the path of WIDE1-1,SSn-N so that they get FIRST and LAST digi 
identification.  These packets will arrive as DIGI1,DIGIn*,SSn-N, 
showing the first and last DIGI's used.

3) UIDUPE to 30.  This is a new command in version 9.1 roms.


FIFTH:  Now set up the digi's own beacons into the network:

1)  Prior to July 09, we used all four LTexts to implement
Proportional Pathing on the digi's own data, so that beacons
went out direct every 10 minutes, but 1 hop every 30 and
2 hops every hour.  Now we only use two LTexts for a direct
10 minute and 2 hop 1 hour beacon so we can use the other two
LTexts for local info to mobiles.  
See www.aprs.org/digis/digi-rates.txt.

 LT  1  DIGI's beacon text (direct every 10 minutes)
 LT  2  DIGI's beacon text (1 or 2 hops every hour)
 LT  3  first frequency object
 LT  4  second frequency object
 BLT 1  EVERY 00:10:00 START 00:00:03  <randomize the seconds
 BLT 2  EVERY 01:00:00 START 00:04:06   "  "
 BLT 3  EVERY 00:10:00 START 00:06:09   "  "
 BLT 4  EVERY 00:10:00 START 00:08:11   "  "
 LTP 1  APN383 VIA WIDE2-2  <== hourly
 LTP 2  APN383 
 LTP 3  APN383 
 LTP 4  APN383 

This results in local info to mobile radio front panels every 
10 minutes, and only one 2-hop beacon once an hour.

2)  Your TOCALL in both the UNPROTO and the LTP's should use the 
TOCALL of APN383 where APN identifies it as digipeater firmware.   
The "3" identifies it as a KPC-3 and the "83" identifies it as ROM 
version.  NOTE, that settings for -early- version 8.2 ROMS are 
different and in a different file, and that version 9.0 should not 
be used at a DIGI, or should be upgraded to the 9.1 Kantronics 
release.  See the APRS list of  TOCALL versions for details of this 
naming convention.  Obviously if you are using a 8.2 or 9.1 then 
use APN382 or APN391...

3) The BText can also be used for another locally recommended voice 
repeater freq object.  Set your UNPROTO path to be direct (APN383 
with no VIAs) since this info is ONLY of value in the footprint of 
this digi and is SPAM everywhere else.  Be sure to include the 
frequency and PL in the correct standardized format as detailed in 
www.aprs.org/localinfo.html.

The following BText format displays not only the Freq and tone info
(T123) but also the range(R45m), net times(Net Th9PM) and meeting 
dates (Mg3rdTh) for all mobiles in 
the area:

BTEXT:
;146.835xy*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrT123 R45m Net Th9PM Mg3rdTh
   or
;146.835xy*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrT123 -060 Net Th9PM Mg3rdTh

BEACON EVERY 10
UNPROTO APN383

This local frequency object is sent DIRECT to make sure it is only 
visible in the area where the repeater can be used!  This eliminates 
QRM and also frustration at seeing frequencies you cannot possibly 
use.  Since these are originated at the digi, they do not QRM anyone, 
beacuse the digi will only transmit them if the channel is clear.  
Notice that the format has been designed to fit nicely on the 
10x10x... byte windows on most mobile displays.  For details see 
www.aprs.org/localinfo.html

SIXTH:  Set large-N TRAPS for abusive paths:

Set UIDIGI ON, WIDE4-4, WIDE5-5, WIDE6-6, WIDE7-7.  These specific 
aliases act like traps because this digi will digipeat them once and 
then no farther.  The closer you get to a high density area, the smaller
N's you should limit.  In typical WIDE2-2 METRO areas, set UIDIGI to 
include WIDE3-3,WIDE4-4,WIDE5-5,WIDE6-6.  Also, if you are getting lots 
of W4-1 packets, for example, from a distant city that is not trapping 
4-4 at the source, you can also trap those specifically by adding WIDE4-1 
to your UIDIGI alias list.  For more on this be sure to see how we did 
it in Los Angeles, and prevented anything above two hops from getting 
into the Los Angeles Basin.  

   http://www.aprs.org/fixingLA.html

*** SPECIAL NOTE FOR KPC-3 DIGIS WITH THE LAST 8.2 VERSION 7265:
This ROM will not work right with WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1 mobile paths unless
one of the UIDIGI Aliases includes WIDE1-1.  So in those digis, set
UIDIGI ON WIDE1-1,WIDE4-4,WIDE3-3,WIDE3-2.


SEVENTH:  Now set the digi to INFORM users of its capabilities and
other local information of value to the mobile operator.  See
www.aprs.org/localinfo.html

1) Set the two DIGI information LOCATION TEXTS with this exact 
format for the consistent display to the users as to the 
capabilities of this digi:
 
   FORMAT: PHGxxxx W2, SSSn-N, remaining comments....

a) "PHGXXXX " plots a cricle showing the working range of the digi
b) "W2, SSSn-N"  informs users of the recommended hops and section.
c) The "S" character between the LAT/LONG shows an "S" overlay
d) If you feel you must use the altitude /A=001377, please add it at 
   the end, not first.  Since those first 20 bytes are the most 
   important to show up on some limited displays (D7  etc).
   In my opinion, Altitude is redundant since the more valuable info
   of height above average terrain is included in PHG.

CONCLUSION:

The best way to set up an APRS digi is to FIRST do a RESET or RESTORE
to FACTORY DEFAULTS to make sure you dont have any bad settings that
have crept into your system.  Then the ONLY commmands  you have to
change are the ones below.  For the Local-Direct BText advertising a 
local voice repeater, I assumed a local Voice repeater on 146.940 with 
a PL of 107 for this example:

MYCALL    XXXXXX <== preferably a LOCATION understood by travelers
MYREMOTE  XXXXXX
MYNODE    XXXXXX-7
NUMNODES  2
INTERFACE TERMINAL
RTEXT   (your secret password string)
BText  ;146.835xy*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrT123 R45m Net Th9PM Mg3rdTh
UNPROTO APN383  <== ID's the KPC-3+ ver 8.3 local,direct no VIA's
HID OFF 
CD SOFTWARE
TXD 18
XMITLVL xxx <== adjust to well below distortion point

LT  1 !DDMM.hhNSDDDMM.hhW#PHGphgd W2, SSn-N, new digi in kalamazoo, etc
LT  2 !DDMM.hhNSDDDMM.hhW#PHGphgd W2, SSn-N, new digi in kalamazoo, etc
LT  3 ;EL-123456*111111zDDMM.hhNEDDDMM.hhW0FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn CALLSIGN-R
LT  4 ;IRLP-4040*111111zDDMM.hhNIDDDMM.hhW0FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn oXXX CALLSIGN
       The first two DIGI LTexts must be identical so the Position 
       Beacon is not always changing and using up the new-posit LOG 
       files on every user's PC...

BLT 1    EVERY 01:00:00 START 00:00:03
BLT 2    EVERY 00:10:00 START 00:04:06
BLT 3    EVERY 00:10:00 START 00:06:13
BLT 4    EVERY 00:10:00 START 00:08:17
LTP 1    APN383 VIA WIDE2-2   
LTP 2    APN383 
LTP 3    APN383 
LTP 4    APN383 

UIDIGI ON WIDE4-4,WIDE5-5,WIDE6-6,WIDE7-7 
UIFLOOD SS,30,ID       <for your SS state or SSS or SSSS ARRL section
UITRACE WIDE,30        <makes all WIDEn-N traceable
UIDUPE 30              <new command for the 9.1 ROMS

LOCAL VOICE REPEATER RECOMMENDEDl:  Use the LTexts and the BText to 
show the locally recommended voice repeater objects and frequencies for 
travelers through the area.  These objects go DIRECT only and the 
freqnecy shows up on the front panel of all APRS mobiles with displays 
in their cars.

BText: ;146.835xy*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrT123 R45m Net Th9PM Mg3rdTh
   or
BText: ;146.835xy*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrT123 oXXX Net Th9PM Mg3rdTh

This shows the 146.835-a repeater (xy make it unique)
with a TONE of 123 HZ (leave off tenths)
with a weekly net at 9 PM on Thursdays
with Monthly meetings on the 3rd Thursday
with a range of 45 miles or an offset of +000 or -000 in 10's of KHz

BEACON E 10     <== every 10 minutes direct
UNPROTO APN383

see the web page: www.aprs.org/localinfo.html

That's all there is to it.  Please don't diddle with any other 
parameters.  The defaults for those are the correct settings.  If you
dink with them you can only make performance worse.  Also please use
the consistent abbreviations for Wn, SSn-N so users know what is going 
on.
