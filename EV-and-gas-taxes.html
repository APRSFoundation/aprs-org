<B>Vehicles have two impacts on the state:</B>  With the demise of coal, Fossil Fuels for transportation are the biggest
remaining Energy emissions impact on our state.  Vehicles add <B><i> wear-and-tear </B></i>
to both the <B><i> roads </B></i> and the <B><i> environment </B></i>.   Currently,
Fossil fueled vehicles pay only a road-usage fee via the Gas tax, but they do not pay for the pollution and the environment they are
consuming.  Similiarly, EV's pay a huge environmental benefit, but are not paying the road tax as shown
in the graphic above right.  
Any consideration of adding a road-use fees to EV's should also end the
<B>Free-Ride</B> that fossil fueled vehicles get with resepect to their wear-and-tear on the environment.

<B>Inequities Today:</B> For visualization, these charts to the right shows usage/consumption above the line and benefits below.  
Current impacts are shown solid, and future fees are shown hashed.

As shown, both fossil fuel vehicles and EVs have a usage impact on the roads.  
Gas cars pay a gas tax for the roads but their huge cost in environmental damage is not being collected.  
Conversely, EV road fees are not currently being collected but EV environmental benefits are real.  
The pollution cost of the fossil fuel vehicles adds to their usage impact, whereas, 
the environmental benefits of the EVs shown in green tend to balance out their road load 
for a net-0 overall cost now.  This apparent free ride for a few EVs is accepted now because 
of their significant benefit in reducing pollution.  Considering environmental impacts and 
road usage costs, then, we can consider a degree of parity between gas and EVs today



<P>
<B>EquityTomorrow:</B> But, as we consider possibly raising usage fees on EVs, to be fair, 
we need to also raise the pollution fee on fossil fueled vehicles as shown above (right).  
The solid colors in the figures are currently paid.  To maintain parity in the future, 
the hashed colors need to be paid by both vehicles.  As we raise the road fee on the EVs, 
there must be a comparable and equal rise in the pollution fee on fossil fueled vehicles.

<P>
The mechanism for collecting these fees is probably at the MVA.
 This new usage fee is inversly proportional to EPA rated MPG for all fossil fueled vehicles including hybrids.  For all EV's and PHEV's the fee
is similarly inversly proportional to MPGe.  This maintains equity across all Vehicles regardless of tonnage, size, weight, hybrid status or battry size.
  
To maintain fairness, all income from fossil fuels go to Air Quality and the environment impacted by these vehicles and 
all fees from EVs go to the roads.
