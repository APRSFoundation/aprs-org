DIGIPEATER IDENTIFICATION (POSIT and POSIT COMMENT) PLANNING        WB4APR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated 27 Aug 2008

Before the New-N Paradigm, we had too many digis beaconing too often too
far and inefficiently.  And most used the HID packet which is useless on 
APRS and just sixtuples QRM.

The New-N Paradigm fixed all that (www.aprs.org/fix14439.html) by 
recommending digipeater settings that will assure not only fully legal 
operation, but also quick local reaction times, regional coverage, and yet 
lighten the load on the network significantly.  The idea is for the DIGI 
to make itself known locally every 10 minutes (direct) and less often 
further out.  This assures that new arrivals or someone just 
turning on their radio will be updated to all working local assets within 
10 minutes, yet not add too many packets elsewhere.

This is important for the mission of APRS as a come-as-you-are real time
responsive system.  The network should support the convergence of lots of 
mobile and portable operators arriving in an area under stress who have no
local knowledge of the system.  THey expect to be updated in 10 minutes 
from arrival.    To those 24/7 fixed stations that just monitor APRS in its
static benign daily condition, these rates may appear excessive, but 
remember, 24/7 inactivity is NOT the mission of APRS...

HID OFF:  First turn the TNC HID function to OFF.  This ID packet is not 
an APRS format and uses the same path as the UNPROTO and goes out every 
10 minutes if on.  This, plus a bad UNPROTO path of 3 hops generates 
almost 100 HID packets per hour per digi in the area.  HID must be turned  
off, because by default the TNC has it on.

REDUCING DIGI BEACON QRM:  Further, The New-N paradigm optimized the 
beacon rate as noted above.  The sugestions below can have a 3 to 6 
fold reduction in DIGI beacons while still meeting the goals of APRS and 
the local ID  requirement.

DIGI BEACON RATE SYSTEM FOR NEW n-N PARADIGM:

Every 10 minutes a local direct posit
Every 30 minutes a 1 hop area posit
Every 60 minutes a 2 hop regional posit

KPC-3+ settings:
 HID OFF
 UNPROTO APN383    <== no via for direct BTexts announcing local info
 BEACON EVERY 10   <== but ONLY for direct BTexts with local info
 BLT 1    EVERY 00:30:00 START 00:00:00
 BLT 2    EVERY 00:30:00 START 00:10:00
 BLT 3    EVERY 01:00:00 START 00:20:00
 BLT 4    EVERY 01:00:00 START 00:50:00
 LTP 1    APN383 
 LTP 2    APN383 
 LTP 3    APN383 VIA WIDE2-1
 LTP 4    APN383 VIA WIDE2-2    <==equivalent to a user path of WIDE3-3>

The below figure shows the timing in 10 minute blocks of the number of 
hops the position packet will take.  A direct Local user will hear a 
packet every 10 minutes, but those out 1 hop will only hear one every 
30 minutes and those out 2 hops will only hear one every hour.  The 
numbers below show the WIDEn-N packets as they count down and arrive in 
each area.  A "0" means the packet is direct and will go no farther..  


LOC     0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 
1-HOP       0     1     0     1     0     1     0     1     0     1    
2-HOP             0           0           0           0           0      


*** ALTERNATE FOR SPARSE N-N AREAS WHERE USERS MAY BE USING LONGER PATHS:

EVERY  10 minutes a local direct Posit
Every  20 minutes a 1 hop Posit
Every  40 minutes a 2 hop Posit
Every 160 minutes a 3 hop posit 

KPC-3+ settings:
 HID OFF
 UNPROTO APN383    <== no via for direct BTexts announcing local info
 BEACON EVERY 10   <== but ONLY for direct BTexts with local info
 BLT 1    EVERY 00:20:00 START 00:00:00
 BLT 2    EVERY 00:40:00 START 00:10:00
 BLT 3    EVERY 01:20:00 START 00:30:00
 BLT 4    EVERY 02:40:00 START 01:10:00
 LTP 1    APN383 
 LTP 2    APN383 VIA WIDE2-1
 LTP 3    APN383 VIA WIDE2-2    
 LTP 4    APN383 VIA WIDE3-3    

The below figure shows the timing in 10 minute blocks how the WIDEn-N 
packets will count down and arrive in each area.  A "0" means the 
packet is direct and will go no further..   
 
LOCAL 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 3 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 . 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 3 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 . 0 1
1-HOP   0   1   0   2   0   1   0       0   1   0   2   0   1   0       0
2-HOP       0       1       0               0       1       0
3-HOP               0                               0


*** RECOMMENDED FOR UIDIGI ROMS THAT ONLY HAVE 3 PATHS:  (rumor has 
it that the offset system in the UIDIG ROM is not working correctly 
and so this proposal doesnt work.  We are waiting for someone to come 
up with the optimum work-around...  Here was the idea:

#1 DIRECT       every 30 mins starting at 10
#2 VIA WIDE     every 30 mins starting at 20
#3 VIA WIDE2-2  every 60 mins starting at  0

That will get you a local packet every 10 mins, a WIDE every 30, 
and a WIDE2-2 every hour on the hour.  The only problem is that
once every hour on the half hour, you wont get one.   But 5 out 
of 6 ain't bad, since the rest of it works so well.  And if you are
a local sysop for more than one, and keep their clocks reasonably
close, then #3 on half the digis you can make "at 30" and the
other one "at 0" so that the hour-one from one digi comes out
when the other digi is missing one... etc...


LTEXTS SHOULD BE IDENTICAL:

Please remember that the LTexts 1 through LT 4 must have identical 
positions and position comment text.  This is beacuse, by definition, 
an APRS station (or this digi) can only have one and only one position
on line at any time.  Thus if one tries to be creative by letting the 
digi comment field contain a rolling bulletinboard of useful text, this
appears to all user softwares as a "CHANGED" position report and so the
logging is triggered to record this "change" every time.  Thus, these 
digis could consume over 148 lines per day in everyone's LOG files.

So, be sure to keep the LText's identical.

And REMEMBER the goal throughout North America is to move all WIDEn-N
digipeating to the UITRACE parameter so that ALL WIDEn-N packets will
be traced for better network management.  This leaves UIFLOOD available
for SSn-N's which even at 7-7 only go so far and can support state or
section wide events.
