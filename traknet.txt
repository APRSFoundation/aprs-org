                           
                           THE APRS/AMSAT TRAKNET
                             

    Commercially, there are two distinct advantages of the global nature
of satellites which cannot be easily met with terrestrial systems:  wide-
bandwidth point-to-point and mobile applications.  With the availability 
of telephone, cable, and the internet to link HAMS at fixed sites to each 
other routinely, we are wasting a lot of potential of our very valuable 
AMSAT resources by ignoring mobile applications.

     HAM radio is on the move.  Any survey will likely show that many
hams only have time to play radio while mobile, and similarly, whenever
a ham contemplates a long trip, his HAM radio is high on the priority
list.  Although many dream of taking along an HF mobile to play with 
and to report their progress back home, the $1000 to $2000 investment  
is just too much of a risk.   Two meters is fun, and can bring emergency
aid, but it just doesn't provide the nationwide coverage that is needed
for the the mobile HAM traveler far from home, the offshore boater, or 
first-response teams arriving in a disaster area.  In many cases, just 
a brief position/status report is all that is needed to assure the health 
and welfare of the traveler or to summon assistance or alert other comms
channels.

     Many hams have put together some impressive mobile satellite 
stations, but the performance is poor and takes a major investment in $$$, 
size and weight.  The reason is that they are essentially duplicating a 
typical weak-signal home satellite station on wheels.  What we need is a 
new perspective which takes advantage of some very unique capabilities to 
exploit a small portion of our AMSAT on-orbit capacity to the mobile 
requirement.  Fortunately, there are several AMSAT's that are VERY EASY
to transmit to from the mobile using only a 2 meter 25 watt FM mobile 
radio.  The ubiquitous radio that EVERYONE has...

UPLINKS:   Lets look at the 1200 baud PACSAT uplinks.  These uplinks are 
unique for several resons that make them ideal for the mobile environment 
as follows:

  1)  The 2m uplink from a mobile omni antenna has a 9 dB advantage over 
        a similar 435MHz link due to the 3 times larger antenna aperture
  2)  There is no tuning or tracking required on the uplink since the 
        doppler on 2m is less than 3 KHz.
  3)  Any 25 watt mobile 2m FM rig can be used as the transmitter
  4)  Any TAPR-2 compatible TNC can be modified for the uplink for $2
  5)  World Wide Coverage
  6)  NO software or hardware on-orbit modifications to the satellite.

Reportedly stations running as low as 7 watts into an indoor omni antenna
have reported success with the PACSATS.  THis means that even back-
packers with an HT and handheld gain antenna could get emergency or 
priority traffic into a Pacsat...  from anywhere on earth!

DOWNLINK:  OK, so the 2m UPLINK is easy and anyone can do it, so what 
about the downlink?  This is not so easy.  The path loss omni-to-omni 
is 9 dB worse, the satellite is only transmitting a watt or so for 
another 10 dB worse performance, plus it REQUIRES doppler tuning, a $250 
PACSAT modem and a $1000 all mode UHF receiver!  In most cases, all 
successful pacsat stations use high gain antennas and automatic tracking 
to make up for the almost 19 dB performance loss on the downllink.  This 
is not something that most operators will want to add to their mobile.  
But what if the mobile application did not need to receive data, but
only send it?

TRAKNET:  The combination of EASY uplinks, MINIMUM downlinks, and an
application that often only needs a one way exchange of data, such as the
mobile position/status report is the whole idea behind TRAKNET.  Only a 
few automated downlinks are needed every 1000 miles or so to receive the 
mobile data and to provide it into a nationwide system of linked ground 
stations.  These ground stations relay the mobile position/status reports 
onto local mobile vehicle tracking channels and onto the internet.  Anyone 
may access the data live on VHF, HF or via the internet.  TRAKNET is not
just a future idea, it can be implemented immediately with existing
equipment and satellites.  Yes, even the INTERNET ground stations exist.
Any Mac/WinAPRS or APRS+SA station can serve as a live internet Igate.

MOBILE STATION:  A mobile station consists of nothing more than a typical 
2 meter FM radio and a modified TAPR-2 compatible TNC as shown in figure
1.  Optional accessories are a GPS for moving position reports, and a 
laptop for modifying the status message.  Most modern TNC's will accept 
the GPS data directly and will transmit the data in a timed packet burst.
There are even tiny handheld TNC's available that include front panel
switches for selecting 1 of 7 pre-canned status messages without needing
a laptop to change the status report.  The modifications to the TAPR-2
TNC are to simply EXclusive OR the transmit data with its 1200 Hz clock
and to filter the result to the Mic input of the radio.  The following
circuit will do this with nothing but an 89 cent standard 7400 quad
2 input NAND gate connected to the two points shown.

TRAKNET PROTOCOL:  The problem with any AMSAT is the very low bandwidth 
available compared to the very large worldwide amateur population.  At
first glance, the prospect of increasing the number of users on a Pacsat
channel by a hundred fold raises lots of red flags in the minds of those
stations who already find the 10 minutes of a satellite pass to be too
short for any meaningful dialoge.  But what if each of these hudreds of
of new users was limited to only a few seconds per orbit?  Then as many
as 200 stations per footprint could be tracked.  That is the only objective
of the TRAKNET protocol, to allow everyone to transmit a few single 1 
second position/status reports during the closest point of approach over 
their location. 

TRAKNET SATELLITES:  There are currently three operational 1200 baud Pacsats
on orbit.     Here is the frequency plans of the existing PACSATS:

DIGIPEATER FM Manchester UPLINKS                  DOWNLINKs
---------- -------------------------------------- ---------
AO-16                 .860      .900 .920 .940    437.051
LU-19            .840 .860 .880 .900              437.153
IO-26                     .875  .900  .925  .950  435.822

                                       
ADVANCED MOBILES:  While the preceeding was written to emphasize the
ease of using the PACSATS by anyone for emergency or priority status/
position reporting, there is certainly no reason why a full two way
PACSAT communications system cannot be added to most mobiles.  Omni
PACSAT downlinks are possible and the addition of only a modest gain
antenna will certainly help.  Advantages are the small size of a 6 dB
two element UHF antenna and the SHORT cable run found in a mobile.
Rather than a $1000 SSB rig, a $90 QRP HF rig and a UHF downconverter
would do just as well.

CONCLUSION:  The advent of the handheld GPS unit for under $200 has 
brought thousands of mobile amateur radio operators into the world of 
mobile data.  For years, the growth of amateur GPS applications have
been growing at phenomenal rates.  Similarly, the state-of-the-art in
automatic PACSAT ground station has
been improving with many recent software packages to make un-attended
automatic ground station quite easy.  The problem is that these two 
communities of expertise have so far had little cross-interests.  It
seems that the time is now to merge these technologies into a new amateur
application that takes advantage of the unique capabilities of each  
and fuels the develpoment of an Amateur Radio Mobile Satellite System.  
TRAKNET is the opportunity to not only merge these interests into a 
common purpose, but also to demonstrate amateur radio's continuing 
progress in comunications technology.
