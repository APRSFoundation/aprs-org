FIGURING YOUR 50 USER ALOHA NETWORK                         WB4APR
------------------------------------------------------------------

At about one second per packet, this means that in a 30 minute period 
maximum possible throughput on a 1200 baud channel is 1800 packets.
But this ignores the fact that a collision anywhere in a packet
destroys both packets usually, so the actual relaible figure is usually
about 2/3rds of that.  But for the optomistic, we will use the 1800
number..
 
Now, how you use those local 1800 packets per 30 minutes is debatable,
but, it is very easy to calculate based on who and what is on the air
in the area.  The packet rates of most categories of stations is well
known.  The following table suggests a typical local area usage:
 
TYPE STATION         PKTS/30m ea  Total  PCT of LOAD
-------------------  -----------  -----  -----------
30 Home stations            2       60      19  %
 3 LOCAL digis (evy 10m)    3        9       3  %
 9 2nd-tier digis (evy 30m) 1        9       3  %
 5 area WX stations         6       30       7  %
 3 Mobiles evy 5m           6       18       6  %
 3 Mobiles evy 3m          10       30       9  %
 3 mobiles evy 2m          15       45      14  %
 3 mobiles evy 1m          30       90      28  %

59 TOTAL USER STATIONS
TOTAL PACKETS IN THE 30 MINUTES =  321 

But, every one of these packets is usually digipeated by usually
every digipeater.  In the above example there are 3 digis in range
of this example so the 321 packets is really more than 960 local
copies.  AND this does not count any of the 2 hop or greater packets 
coming in from the surrounding 9 digipeaters further out!  At this
point, lets just assume that HALF the traffic comes from them.

What should be painfully clear is that with just 2 hop packets
this area is totally saturated with only about 60 users.
You can trade these numbers anyway you want, but you cannot
change the laws of physics that says the optimum reliable
throughput for our 1200 baud ALOHA channel is about 60 or
so average users.  In your local area, you can add several more fixed 
stations for every 1 minute mobile you eliminate.  Or, you have to 
eliminate a lot of home stations (or suffer much worse reliability)
to accept the load of just one more high-rate mobile.  

It should be very clear that the path to reliability is to cut the
number of hops used and hopefully out of area packets will not be
so burdensome on the local net.  APRSdos and hopefully other APRS
programs displays this local reliable range of the nearest N 
stations  based on what it hears so that the user is well informed
of his effective communications range and will keep his packets
within that area by keeping his path short.
