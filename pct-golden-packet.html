<B>PCT Status for 2020</B>  Due to little aactivity, the Yahoogroup email reflector expired at the end of 2019.
Please join the overall GOlden Packet group <i><B>(atgp) on groups.io </B></i>
to volunteer and to coordinate efforts.  Thanks to Barry Thaysen for setting 
this up in 2011.  Martin, KI6WJP prepared a PATH list in 2011 to help organize planning.

<B>Now Success yet out west...</B> We tried to organize in 2011 and 2012 and to get more hams involved, we scheduled the
Golden Packet Event to coincide with the 
<A HREF="http://www.ldsfacts.net/ontarget.htm"><B>National Scouting's Operation ON-Target</B></A>.
  This 
Scout event involves dozens of mountains and troops throughout the western state's
mountains.  Rather than duplicating their detailed organization we simply ask all APRS
hams wanting to participate to join up with any of these EXISTING expeditions
to Operation ON-Target mountains and just make sure that an APRS radio goes along.  
The On-Target map at right shows the 2012 map.  Go here to see the live
interactive map of all present 
       <A HREF="http://goo.gl/maps/zc33"><B> ON-Target Mountains and Teams</B></A>.
It is growing daily.

<P>
<B>2012 - Joint APRS and Operation On-Target!</B> We need to start planning the involvement
of APRS GOlden Packet concepts with the western On-Target concepts.  Much of this page 
is historical when we tried to organize the Pacific APRS links on their own.  Use it for plannning the
APRS Golden Packet portion of your adventure, but do all site planning and team coordination within the existing
Operation ON-TARGET web pages and organizations.  Then report here, how the Golden 
Packet portion worked out west this year.

<P>
<B>2011 Summary:</B> The 2011 APRS planning was ramping
up quickly for an attempt on the PCT, but they just ran out of time at the
last minute.  Lets hope that joining up with Operation ON-Target in future years will help!  
Here was the
<A HREF="hamtrails/PCT-plan2011.JPG"><B> 2011 map</B></A>.
<P>

<B>Objective:</B>
This page is dedicated to organizing an APRS Packet Message Golden Packet event
along the West coast comparable to the one the Easties do on the
<A HREF="at-golden-packet.html"><B>Appalachian Trail</B></A>.  The Objective is
to communicate with APRS Messaging from Border to Border or hundreds of miles
by using strategically located portable digipeater sites.  For this short 3 hour
event, the 144.34 packet balloon channel will 
be used that will not see any interference from the normal APRS
system.  But since this is a primary ATV frequency in LA, we will have to use
a different VHF freq around the SOCAL to keep the peace.
<P>
With the much higher mountains of California, this could be done with fewer
hops than the 14 it takes in the Appalachians.  The key to success is to
make links ACROSS Valleys, to get the maximum height above average terrain.
You can see in the map to the left how the RF path zig-zags with only
occasional sites on the actual trail.  There is no requirement to have the
temporary stations anywhere near the trail, because as long as they are high
up, they can be accessed from the trail.  The goal of most sites is easy
access so that the event can occur on Sunday without a lot of special effort
by a lot of teams.  Drive-up sites are ideal.

<P> 
<B>Golden Packet goal is DISTANCE:</B> Look at the map above and look for end-to-end
long chain possibliities.  Then join up with those scout/ham teams and make sure
they carry APRS and a digipeater on the special event frequency of 144.34 during
the event.  See the original <A HREF="at-golden-packet.html"><B> Golden Packet
web page</B></A> for all APRS settings and operations.  You do not want to saturate
the channel with side-to-side dead-end links.  So concentrate on long chain serial
mountains.  This drastically cuts down on the packet QRM.  You only will hear 2
copies of each packet in a chain.  But in a 2 dimensional side-to-side area, you would
hear a huge multiplicaiton of dupes.  Stations not on the major long chains can
just operate normal APRS on the national channel and still be seen.


<P>
<B> Why are we doing this?</B>
For the last
30 years, Packet Radio just <i>ain't got no respect</i> at the national Field Day
events, so we have begun our own outdoors VHF packet radio field event!  
This page is focused on the Pacific Crest Trail shown here to the left. 
  We need to get enough internet-junkies out of their shacks.
<P>
Here were the volunteers last year (2011):

This Golden Packet amateur radio communications event on the Pacific Coast states
is designed to allow individuals on very high and widely
separate peaks from San Diego to Seattle or anywhere along the Rockies to attempt to relay  
text messages from hikers using hand-held radios the 2000 mile length of the 
Pacific Crest, or other long National trails or mountain chains.  
Of course, this is to be a no impact 
<A HREF="http://www.lnt.org"><B>Leave-No-Trace</B></A> communications test of a few 
individuals at each relay point to support possible other hikers equipped with APRS 
ham radios  along the trail.   APRS normally does not do long haul RF, 
due to the omni-directional flooding of packets which causes QRM.  But for LINEAR trails,
there are NO <i> dupes</i> to worry about, and long haul along a trail is a great demo
of emergency point-to-point communications.
<P>

<P>

<B>PURPOSE:</B>  To find suitable, easy-to-reach sites which can be activated easily
for potential backup emergency communications links across the USA.  Amateur Radio
has long been known to provide backup communications capability to public service
agencies when needed.  We will
demonstrate our ability to communicate 
<A HREF="aprs-messaging.html"><B>positions and messages</B></A>
 along the length of the Pacific Mountains.
Normally considered a 2000 mile hike, the Pacific RF path is on the order of 
only 1500
miles and we hope to do this in only 10 hops. 

<P>

<B>WHEN:</B>  Annually the 3rd Saturday in July.  For 2012 it is 21 July and this
also coincides with the 
<A HREF="http://www.arrl.org/contests/soapbox/index.html?con_id=94&amp;call=W4IY&amp;bbycall=1">
<B>CQ World Wide VHF Contest</B></A>.  The General Western PLAN for the Saturday is to get the APRS portion done before 12:00 Mountain time when the CQ worldwide contest begins:
<P>
<LI> 0800 to 1000 Station set up  (coordinate on your PUBLISHED local repeater, and APRS on 144.39, and CQSRVR)
<LI> 1000 to 1100 Station checkouts (voice with adjacent nodes on 445.925 (no tone), messages via HOP2-2 or so)
<LI> 1100 to 1200 Golden packet attempts from both ends only (using HOP7-7,HOP7-7 paths)
<LI> 1200 to 1400 DIGIPEATER Site-to-site messaging only (using HOP7-7,HOP7-7 paths)
<LI> 1400 to 1500 All other TRAIL hikers and DIGIPEATER stations 
<LI> 1500 to 1600 Any other APRS or packet stations in range
<LI> 1600 to 2000 Tear down and go home

<P>
<IMG SRC="hamtrails/AT-event-RF.JPG" height=300 width =230 align=right>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.lnt.org"><B>LEAVE-NO-TRACE:</B></A> To respect the environment
and other outdoorsmen, this will be a low-impact event in a public place.
We want to not impact other visitors, yet have a good time and introduce amateur radio
to anyone nearby.  Same goes for any hikers.  We must stay well below the threshold
that would trigger concern by any National, State, or local park authority and
require copious red-tape.  They have <i> <B> event</B> application fees </i> 
as much as $100 each, so it must be very clear to even the casual observer 
that this is <B>NOT</B> a <i> park <B>event</B> </i> though we have traditionally used
the term <i> event</i> in amateur radio to describe a <i> convergence of activity
<B> on-the-air</B></i>.  That is why we have a designated leader at each site to organize
any participation without triggering park concern.  For 2009 on the AT we luckally
got the OK of the ATC Ranger but had to do a lot of
<A HREF="hamtrails/AT-permission.txt"><B> explaining</B></A> to insure the 
low impact of our plans.  One team  made the mistake 
of trying to get an <i>event</i> approval and nearly got denied access to the park.
See our <A HREF="hamtrails/roan-letter.txt"><B>attempted letter</B></A> to try to
recover.  There is no law or rule against opeating an Amateur Radio
mobile in a park, just follow all existing rules and remain <B><i>no-impact</i></B>
<P>
<B>VOLUNTEERS: </B> Rather than forming up brand new APRS teams, it is far easier to simply
take APRS along with existing ham and scout ON Target teams.
  Showing them what we can do with our APRS radios should have some interest
to a few of them.  Most day hikers are really into GPS, so why not APRS too? . 
To sign up as a volunteer, please contact <i>wb4apr at amsat dot org</i> or
better, contact the individuals and team leaders for each team on each of the
station web pages below.  Due to the height of these stations, probably half of all
east cost hams can monitor the test in the shaded yellow area shown at right.
<P>

<P>
<B>APRS BACKGROUND: </B> Although the APRS network provides full coverage over most of
the country on the USA APRS channel of 144.39 MHz, this national channel is a very 
heavily shared asset concentrating on local coverage and support.  Long haul 
communications is not possible nor encouraged due to congestion.  . For this 3 hour
Golden Packet test, we use the special uncongested frequency normally used
for Balloons and ATV audio (144.34) just for these 3 hours.  But this channel is
heavily used in Southern California and will be an issue.
Using amateur radio from mountian peaks is part of the 
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/peak2peak.yahoogroups.com"><B>peak2peak</B></A> and
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/sota.uk"><B>SOTA</B></A> projects, but to reduce the risk of RF
congestion, this test is planned to avoid any VHF contest weekend.
<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/Radios08xX.JPG" height=200 width=240 align=right>
<P>
<B>SIGNIFICANT APRS CHARACTERISTICS FOR THIS TEST:</B>

<LI> 1) Trail stations will use the short path HOP7-7,HOP7-7 for all traffic
<LI> 2) Trail stations may use the traceable TEMPn-N for short tests
<LI> 3) Stations should be able to see all adjacent nodes in both directions
<LI> 4) Being linear links, there will be few dupes and little QRM.  
<LI> 5) D700/710s are required for consistent TEMPn-N and HOPn-N digi's.

<P>
The reason for the radio specific requirement is due to the elimination of 
ALL potential set-up, configuration, and interfacing issues.  See below.

<P>
<B>STATION AND ROUTE PLANNING:</B>  For maximum range between hops, the best path for all
trails from Georgia to Maine or San Diego to Seattle, ZIG/ZAGs as shown on the
above maps rather than trying 
to shoot straight along the ridge.  The height-above-average-terrain between the
peaks along the trail ridge is significanly less than across valleys and drastically
limits line of sight distances. . But zig/zagging from the 
peaks to adjacent mountain ranges and back across valleys, takes 
advantage of <i>thousands</i> of feet difference in heights above
average terrain and allows us to make much greater distances in fewer hops.
<P>

<B>GOOGLE EARTH DOES RAY TRACING! (sort of)...</B> See the views created in The free
Google Earth to see the RF paths and ground clearance.
<A HREF="hamtrails/aprsGoogleEarth.txt"><B>(anyone can do this)</B></A>.  
You can also get these views with APRS stations actually plotted on them on
both The <A HREF="http://openaprs.net"><B>OpenAPRS</B></A> and 
<A HREF="http://aprs.fi"><B>APRS.fi</B></A> sites. . 
  If  you zoom into any of the links below, you can see these 3D views including
the heights of The rays.
<P>

<P>

<B>STATION CALLSIGNS-SSID's:</B>  Since there are 15 stations, we used
the 15 SSID's in sequence for the convenience of knowing the
relationships between sites along the way.  Specific callsigns have been
assigned so that messaging can occur in the blind.  Please see the
<A HREF="hamtrails/golden-checklist.txt"><B>callsign list</B></A>.  
The sequence is South to North
which is the usual direction of through-hikers who begin the treck in the spring
in Georgia and hope to end by the Fall in Maine.
<P>

<B>STATION TEXT: </B> Initially, each station sets  his position text to
include his FCC call 
and his estimated event-end-time.  Something like
<i>WB4APR till 1600EDT</i> (meaning 1400 Eastern Daylight Time). 
But as he begins to see other stations, 
he can show what he is seeing by including their X# in his text.  
Example:  WB4APR till 1600 QSL:12345689ABC which means WB4APR can see other stations 
as far south as 1 and as far north as 12 ("C" in Hex) and all stations in between.

<P>
<B>FREQUENCY - Packet and UHF coordination:</B>  Finding a clear frequency for
the 4 hour event is a severe problem.  Since the duration of this event is
about the same as the duration of a Balloon flight, and just as exciting,
we asked the ATV Balloonests if we could operate on 144.34.  
For simplex voice coordination, the national APRS FM simplex channel of 
445.925 is used.  In
addition, parallel operation of a second APRS station on the national 
144.39 can also be used for end-to-end coordination.  The below diagrams show 
how a TM-D7 dual band APRS radio can serve
all functions of Digipeater, Text Messagingand Voice coordination.  While a
D7 HT can be used for the 144.39 normal APRS opertaion.
<P>

<IMG SRC="hamtrails/splitter.GIF">
<P>

<B>ECHOLINK COORDINATION:</B>  Since this is a communications exercise, we also like to
test our ability to establish voice communications with all the sites
 while we are up there.  Each site can call into a conference server set up for this
event via a UHF Echolink node near their mountain.  To find the nearest EchoLink node
please see the <A HREF="http://www.echolink.org/links.jsp"><B>Echolink node finder</B></A>.
Its a good idea to get permission to use the local node.  We can use this for 
end-to-end overall coordination from 11 AM to noon.  Think of it!  End-to-end Voice,
end-to-end APRS messaging (on 144.39 via IGates) and hopefully end-to-end APRS on 
RF alone for the test.
<P>
For the 2009 conference node, WB3GXW has offered his
<A HREF="http://www.artscipub.com/repeaters/comments.asp?rid=21947&amp;ln=WB3GXW-repeater-information-on-147.225-in-Silver-Spring,-Maryland">
<B>*WASHDC*</B> node, number 6154 </A> for this
test.  Just connect in at 11 AM and join in (AT Stations only).

<P>
<B>POSITION PACKET RATES:</B>  To maximize the potential for getting
messages through, EVERYONE should limit his TX period to no less than
10 minutes to give reasonalbe info latency while keeping background channel loading low.  
Each digi will hear two other digis direct, but will hear up to 14 other 
station position reports (using 7-7, 7-7 hops). . So for these 15 position packets, 
the channel will be
blocked for 3 seconds each or 45 seconds total in 10 minutes or about 8%. .
This is close to half of the channel ALOHA capacity and leaves plenty of room
for the messages.  Hopefully Mic-E format will be used for efficiency.

<P>
<B>MESSAGE PACKET RATES:</B>  The other half of ALOHA channel capacity is
for message packets.  Using the above logic, once The Phase-I golden end-to-end
packets have been successful, Phase-II communications between other stations
should be limited to only one message every 10 minutes outgoing too. . 
During set-up and throughout the test, end-to-end APRS coordination is easy
on 144.39 either normal operation or via the CQSRVR with messages
to CQ AT CQ AT. (<A HREF="cqsrvr.html"><B>see CQSRVR</B></A>).
<P>
<IMG SRC="hamtrails/AT-digi-config.JPG">
<P>

<B>DIGIPEATER HARDWARE:</B>
The Mountain top Digipeaters consist of a D700/D710, 
a mast as required to clear the trees, and a power source.
The mimimum test is 3 hours long, but the optional phases can last up to a total
of 5 hours, so ample AMP-Hr capacity should be considered.  The D700 draws about .6 amps
on receive and the D710 about .7 amps, and about say 4.5 amps on TX (medium power 10W).  
Under normal operation,
the duty cycle of an APRS digipeater is typically 20% so the average power demand
of the AT digipeater will be about .2 * 4.5A +.6A or about 1.5 Amps per hour.
You can either carry a 7.5 Amp Hour battery to the mountain top, or if the day is sunny,
a 1 Amp-Hr battery and a 1.5 amp solar panel as shown.
<P>
We are requesting that only D700 or D710 radios be used as the digipeater, 
since there can be so many different ways for a TNC/radio combo to be tuned
or set up wrong.  Listening to packets on the air, MOST have poor audio, tone, levels,
tone inbalance unknown pre-and-de emphasis and
deviation settings adding up to 20 dB or more in performance loss.  We can eliminate 
these variables by just using D700's that at least were all set for optimum at the
factory, and provide reliable packet operation down to a very good 0.3 uV (-117 dBm).
<P>

<B>DIGI SETTINGS:</B> Each digi along The trail will be set to
support traceable TEMPn-N packets and the shorter non-traceable HOPn-N
path.  The two settings are:  "UITRACE TEMP" and "UIFLOOD HOP,ID" or similar
depending on exact TNC used.  Once these settings are in the D700/710, they can
actually remain there forever since we want all D700/710's always to be able to 
at least support the come-as-you-are  
<A HREF="TEMPn-N.html"><B>TEMPn-N</B></A> backup system.  All D700/710's 
are supposed to be configured with the TEMPn-N support by default for emergency
backup communications at any time.  
TEMPn-N is great for omni-directional temporary communications for
special events like Field Day.  Here we cannot afford the bulk, however, of the
long trace packets using TEMPn-N, so we are using HOP7-7 which should only ID
the last digi in each packet.

<P>

<B>MESSAGE PATHS:  </B>All packets will use the HOP7-7,HOP7-7 path so that
packets will go the length of the trail.  Using this non-traceable path
keeps the packets short.  But to resolve any anomolies, the Traceable TEMPn-N paths 
are also possible for short tests, but these packets grow by 7 bytes at each hop 
and should be avoided
most of the time.  No one knows what will happen beyond that.
 
<P>

<B>POSITION PATHS:</B>  
Using non-traceable HOP7-7,HOP7-7 paths for all position reports,
will drastically reduce the length of each packet.  
As we watch APRS we can see the trail stations appear north and south from each site.

<P>
<B>MESSAGE FORMATS:</B>  For the official long haul Golden Packets that you want
everyone to see, use 
only BULLETINS (BLN#xxxxx).  This eliminates ACKS and QRM, yet lets everyone
read the mail.  To indicate a specific recepient, squeeze their identifier
into the available optional 5 bytes xxxxx, but otherwise the xxxxx is not needed.
Stations with D700's must read and <i>delete</i> incoming messages to make
sure to keep room for more incoming messages.  D710's can hold as many as 100
unread messages.  Keep a paper log if you are not using a
PC APRS as well.

<P>
<B>GOLDEN PACKET TRACING:</B> We only use HOPn-N paths instead of TEMPn-N paths. 
You can see how these packets would get very long, if TEMP7-7 Tracing was used.
The packet can only go 7 hops and would arrive as

SGRLOF-14,MTWASH-13,N1CNA-12,GRYLCK-11,SAMSPT-10,CMLBCK-9,GDHILL-8,TEMP7*</i>
<P>
But using HOP7-7,HOP7-7 it can go 14 hops and arrive simply as:
<i>MDMTN-7,HOP7,MAINE-14,HOP7*</i>.  This shows that it took 7 hops to
get to Maryland Mountains and then 7 more hops to the MAINE RELAY site.

<P>
<B>DUAL SYSTEMS:</B> Each participating digipeater site station
should operate with two APRS stations.

<P>
<LI> Use the main high power station (D700/D710) as the digipeater. It can also
be used for MESSAGES via HOP7-7,HOP7-7. 

<LI> Use an HT or other APRS station on 144.39 for all other information
and chatter either normally or via the CQSRVR.
<P>


<P>
<B>2-WAY IGATES PROHIBITED!</B> It would be a disaster if someone brought up a 2-way IGate on 
the test frequency.  But, on the other hand, having a SINGLE monitor-<b>only</B> Igate
at each end and in the middle might let the world watch-in.  But again, this is playing
with fire, and a missconfigured IGate could spoil the entire event.
