INSTALL.TXT       APRS DOS INSTALLATION
Author(s):        Bob Bruninga, WB4APR@amsat.org
---------------------------------------------------------------------				  
Download the latest version of APRSvvv.ZIP.  Find it on TAPR from 
ftp://ftp.tapr.org/aprssig/dosstuff/APRSdos/   Also get the latest maps 
for your area (see below).  For the new APRStfc Traffic monitoring 
System, get TRAFFIC.ZIP and manually unzip it and move each of its 
files into the proper directory...  Thats all there is to it!

You must manually create an APRS directory and use PKUNZIP 
with the -d option (or WINZIP) to cause it to unzip and properly 
install all sub directories.  

  APRSxxx.zip  - ALL major files.  Builds 6 subdirectories:
		 MAPS - Holds all MAPS     POS      - Overlay files
		 HSTS - History files      SYSTEM   - APRS system files
		 BAKS - BACKUP files       README   - all README files
		 LOGS - LOG directory      MAPLISTS - all maplists
                                       PROGRAMS - misc Basic routines

With only those files you will have basic US Route and interstate
maps of the USA but little detail.  To get more detail maps for
your area of the world, you should also download and install one
or more of the following regional map systems.  The first letter
or two gives you the area and the xx is the version number.
  
Xmapsvv.zip  - Regional maps     
                           Emapsxx.zip  - EAS -Eastcoast maps
				   NEAmapsx.zip - NEA -North East maps (New England)
				   Mmapsxx.zip  - MID -Midwest maps
				   Cmapsxx.zip  - CEN -Central Maps
				   Wmapsxx.zip  - WES -West Maps
				   SEmapsxx.zip - SE  -S.East maps
				   NWmapsxx.zip - NW  -Northwest maps
				   SOmapsxx.zip - SO  -South
				   EUmapsxx.zip - EUR -Europe

There are also map packages for Germany, Finland, the UK, Africa,
Japan, New Zeland, and South America, and Central America, Bosnia.
To activate one of these regional map areas, use the MCC or MAPS-
CONFIG-CHANGE command and indicate the 2 or 3 character abbreviation
shown above.

The EXECUTABLE is always APRSxxx.exe but there is always an APRS.BAT file
that will run the latest program direectly.  Also, there are many APRSdos
executables tailored to specific applications:

   APRSxxx.EXE  The latest version and will do everything.  But only
		can hold about 100 stations
   APRSmax.EXE  Has some stuff removed to make room for 250 stations
   APRStk.EXE   Normal APRS but with Satellite tracking and auto-
		radio tuning for the satellites and RShack rotator control
   APRSdata.EXE A regional data server of Tiny-Web-Pages for Kenwoods
   APRStfc.exe  A regional data server for Traffic Speeds
   APRSdr.EXE   Can dead-reckon runners around a marathon course

And more.  THese you have to download separately from TAPR and also
install with PKUNZIP -d into your APRS directory.

				 
*YOU MUST USE THE PKUNZIP -dn (or WinZIP) TO GET THE APRS SUBDIRECTORIES!

APRSdos will run on any 8088 through 486 PC with CGA,EGA, or VGA.  BUT NEEDS 
ALMOST 550 K of free memory.  You may have to remove TSR's or reduce 
the requirements of your CONFIG.sys.  APRSMIN.EXE will run with only 411K.
APRStxt.EXE will run on TEXT-ONLY palmtops.

APRS will NOT work with non standard video cards, for example, the Hercules 
Video card.  You may make this work marginally by running the readily 
available SIMCGA.COM program with the P option first to make it simulate 
a real CGA device or another TSR called HGCIBM /e.

TO INSTALL APRS on your SYSTEM:               DOS COMMAND
--------------------------------------------  --------------------------------
1.  Create APRS directory on your Harddrive-  MD APRS
2.  Change Directory into that directory   -  CD APRS
3.  Put APRS disk into A and change to A   -  A:      (or B:)
    Do Pkunzip with directories:           -  PKUNZIP -d  APRSxxx.ZIP  C:
4.  Get the maps for your area             -  PKUNZIP -d  Xmapsxx.ZIP C:
    (where X is your region, E,NEA,M,C,SE or W)
5.  Execute APRS   (APRS.BAT is included)  -  APRS
    All APRS commands are spelled out, but are actually single key strokes
    a. Give your call and other info as prompted.
    b. Use MAPS-CONFIG-CHANGE to select MAPs for your area. (see note above)
    c. Move cursor to your QTH using arrow keys and PgDn (shft-PgDN)
    d. Hit INPUT-MY-POS command and answer QTH questions
    e. Use UNPROTO command to set your VIA Digipeater path (needs TNC)
    f. Move and center map to your area of interest and range scale
    g. Save a config file using alt-S-SAVE  (repeat steps b - g at anytime)
    h. Provide your Validation # when requested during the SAVE command.
       (only APRSdos prior to #860 asked for a V#)
    i. WRITE DOWN YOUR V#'s on your wall.  Don't lose them! (Now only
       needed if you want to run an older version)
    
6.  Troubleshooting tips.  READ TROUBLE.txt!
    a. Verify COMMS with TNC using the OPS-COMM-TNC command.
    b. For AEA or KANTRONICS TNC's, set their EXPert ON or INTFACE TERMINAL 
       commmands in order for the TNC to respond to some APRS commands
    
7.  OPERATING TIPS:
    a. APRS.BAT simply executes the latest APRSxxx.EXE version.  As a .BAT
       file, it also makes Windows happier when you exit.
    b. APRS has three command line options:  
       *  APRSxxx/new will execute APRS from a brand new startup
       *  APRSxxx/n will execute APRS and NOT load the last BACKUP file
       *  APRSxxx/xyz will execute APRS from an alternate config file .xyz
	  see 5g above.
    c. You may customize the TNC commands INITIALIZED and RESTORED by APRS
       in the files named InitXXXX.TNC and RESTORE.TNC, etc.
       Add commands or use the * to REM out any unused lines. BE CAREFUL,
       APRS will NOT work unless all the parameters are correct for ur TNC.

My distro disk contains the big USA maps and your regional maps.  You must
check with your local BBS or APRS friends for your own STATE maps.  Look 
for  XXmapsVV.zip where XX is your state abbreviation, and VV is the latest 
Version number.  See MAPS.txt for info on additional maps, and MAPMAKIN.txt 
on how to make maps or to customize your MAPLIST.xxx file to your area.

THE LATEST APRS is posted on the TAPR.ORG FTP site in the directory of
aprssig/dosstuff/APRSdos.  That directory contains all other files for
which I am responsible.  Other local maps may be found one directory up.
Come join the aprsnews@tapr.org on the INTERNET for the latest, or aprssig
@tapr.org for all the discussions!

************    REMEMBER TO USE PKUNZIP -dn    ***********

UPGRADES:  If you are unzipping an upgraded copy of APRS, or any of the 
XMAPS.ZIP files, the command PKUNZIP -dn will unzip only the NEW files.
Then READ NEWNOTES.txt to see what has changed!

See DOWNLOAD.TXT for info on downloading APRS or to join the APRS Email
reflector called APRSSIG... a great place to learn about APRS.

READ: README.1st, APRS.txt, HELP.txt, etc

If you want to zoom into other areas of the country, not included on your
distro disk, simply download and PKUNZIP -dn some of the other map.ZIP
files, and use the MAPS-CONFIG-CHANGE command to temporarily load the
MAPLIST appropriate to the new maps.  Then just zoom in and maps will
automatically appear.  APRS defaults to the MAPLIST.APR which is an exact
copy of MAPLIST.USA.  You can change this default by copying any other
maplist to MAPLIST.APR.  To see the map borders do a MAPS-PLOTS-BORDERS
and then use the [ and ] keys to zoom to different map scales borders.

MINIMUM SYSTEMS:  Despite the 3 Mbyte size of the whole APRS system, a 
minimum system can be built in under 500K with only the .EXE, MAPLIST.xxx, 
at least one .MAP file, and all SYSTEM files.  All directories must be 
at least created even if empty. 

RUNNING ON A and B FLOPPY-ONLY SYSTEMS:  Build a Boot-System disk, copy 
only APRSxxx.EXE onto that disk.  Put that in the A: drive.  On another
disk put as much APRS as you need.  Put ALL of the SYSTEM directory there,
Make MAPS and MAPLISTS directories and put at least the MAPLIST.USA and
USA.MAP files there (add others as you have room).  Then at least create
the LOGS,HSTS,POS,README directories.  Now Boot up on the A drive, Change
default drive to B:.  Then RUN APRSxxx from B: with the command A:APRSxxx.
APRS will then use the B: drive as the default and run just fine.

DISTRO ON TWO 720K FLOPPIES:  It is easy for you to split the APRS distro 
disk for sharing with others on TWO-720K disks as follows:
  1) MD ATEMP                           (make a temporary directory)
  2) PKunzip APRSxxx.zip MAPS\*.* ATEMP (Unzip just the USA MAPS there)
  3) COPY APRSxxx.ZIP APRShalf.zip
  4) PKZIP -d APRShalf.zip  MAPS\*.*    (DELETE all USA maps from this ZIP)
  5) PKZIP USAMAPS.zip ATEMP\*.*        (Zip up all the maps into USAMAPS.zip)
  6) Now copy APRShalf.zip, about 650K onto one disk
	 Copy USAMAPS.zip and your regional XmapsYY.ZIP onto the other....
  7) The 720K user then uses PKUNZIP -dn on the APRShalf and Xmaps files
     then he changes into his MAPS directory and does a regular PKUNZIP
     of the USAMAPS.zip file.

RUN FROM A SINGLE BOOTABLE FLOPPY:
APRSdos can be made to fit on a single SYSTEM disk.  This is useful for
old PC's with dead hard drives for very low cost APRS applications.
To build a single floppy system that will boot the PC and RUN APRSdos
simply unzip the regional distribution for your area into a new directory.
Stick a blank floppy into drive A.  Then in that directory, run the 
MAKESYS.BAT file.   It will SYSTEM the A drive and copy a minimum APRS
set onto the floppy.
