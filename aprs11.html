<P>
<B>This page is always current with any changes to the APRS Spec:</B>  Although the APRS spec was nailed down in 2004, this page captures any details that were not in the original spec document.  This page must be considered part of the spec.  For Example, the SYMBOLS and TOCALLS are constantly being updated (almost montly) as applications and usage grows.
<P>

<B>Updated 3 Nov 2011</B> to add the overlooked requierment for AutoAnswer messages to begin 
with <B>AA:</B> and to auto-cancel when the operator returns.

This copy of the APRS SPEC Addendum 1.1 was approved by the APRS-<A HREF="aprs11/aprswg.txt"><B>WG</B></A> . 
(Vote was called 30 July 2004).
<BR> This APRS1.1 page is always maintianed current such as the SYMBOLS and TOCALLS links below. 
<BR> All new updates and additions to APRS since 2004 are found on the
<A HREF="aprs12.html"><B> APRS 1.2 </B></A> proposed draft addendum.
<BR>For a comparison of what has been implemented in what clients, please see the

<B>APRS SPEC FINALIZED as of July 2004:</B>  This APRS Specification version 1.1 represents
additions, corrections, and deletions since the original APRS1.0 spec of 21 June 2000.
This edition represents the state of
the APRS protocol and its usage through July 2004.  As of this date, the 
<A HREF="aprs11/aprsstats.txt"> <B>state 
of the APRS users</B></A> showed almost 27,000 stations worldwide of which:

<LI>33% are fixed or home stations (includes WX stations)
<LI>36% are infrastructure (30% digis and 6% IGates)
<LI>31% are mobiles

<P>
<B>APRS Mobiles:</B> Of these mobiles, it is interesting to note that almost 60% are transmitting
APRS using the Kenwood D7 or D700 APRS radios but more significantly nearly 85% 
of all mobile APRS users, who view APRS data in their vehicles, use these radios 
as their only source of APRS data while mobile.  Thus,
to the extent that APRS is intended for tactical-real-time local display of
data to end users, compatibility with these mobile users is a significant driver
in the consideration of changes to the APRS Specification.   Another
interesting observation is that about 55% of all APRS stations are firmware
devices (digis, TNC's and trackers and WX stations) that are not easily upgraded.  This
is a testiment to the stability of the APRS protocol and our desire to maintain
compatibility with existing users where possible.
<P> 
<B>APRS is NOT Ham Radio's <I>MOBILE COMPUTING:</I></B>  
The 1200 baud national APRS user
channel cannot and was never intended to be Ham Radio's solution to <i>Mobile
Computing </i>.  The thousand-fold greater bandwidths required for typical
Mobile Computing applications are enormous and there is no attempt to clutter
the APRS channel with all possible data that might be of use to a user with 
a laptop in his car.  APRS is for brief, short data types of immediate Ham Radio interest to
all tactical users on the local RF channel.
<P>
<B>APRS1.1:</B> With the above as background, the following items represent the 
uncontested changes, additions, deletions
or amplifying information included in APRS Specification Addendum 1.1.  There is
no intent to re-publish the spec.  The original document will remain as is, and
these APRS 1.1 revisions will refer back to appropriate pages where noted:

<LI> <B>Auto-Answer messages</B> are SPAM to the network in most cases.  To limit their impact, 
all original APRS clients adhered to these rules for auto-answer messages:
<BR> 1) Any such AA message text should begin with AA:
<BR> 2) Any such AA message should not have a Line number (so it does not cause acks)
<BR> 3) Any such AA message is only sent once on each incoming message packet (no forced retries)
<BR> 4) Any such AA message should default to OFF on power up.
<BR> 5) Any such AA message should be canceled when the client detects the return presence of the operator
<BR> 6) Any such AA message can be ended with a }yy REPLY-ACK if the software supports it

<P>
<B> The above is the complete APRS 1.1 Spec Addendum.</B>  It was a compilation of all
the accumulated feedback from users and authors about errata, errors, typos and any
omissions in the spec that had been accumulated from the time of the original
spec to June 2004.  This APRS erratta page had been running continuously for years
and was updated whenever these items were discovered and each of these items were
widely published and discussed on the APRSSIG and the APRSSPEC working group for
public discussion.  But it was decided best to finally Freeze the accumulation in 
June 2004 as APRS1.1 and then after public posting approve it.  
<P>

Then to begin working on any new issues as APRS1.2.
