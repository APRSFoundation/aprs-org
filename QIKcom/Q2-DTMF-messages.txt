DTMF messages are sent in a 16 key string starting with the message type
identifier (B or C) and ending in #  If the identifier is the B or C key 
then the format of the resulting message is as follows:

    BxxMMCCCCCCkkkk#  Where CCCCCCkkkk are your callsign keys and key code
                      This is used when you want to send the same message
                      easily such as the QSL message #40, 41 or 42.
           or
    CMMxxCCCCCCkkkk#  Where CCCCCCkkkk are your callsign keys and key code
                      and MM is the message number below
                      and xx is a modifier number spoken in place of __

Note:  The wierd spellings below attempt to get the low quality synthesizer
on QIKCOM-2 to sound better (QIKCOM2 was never launched due to a snafu with
the FCC).
