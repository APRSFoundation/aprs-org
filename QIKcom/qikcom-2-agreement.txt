QIKcom-2 USER SERVICE AGREEMENT                            10 Mar 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                WB4APR

SERVICE:

QIKcom-2 provides a worldwide position, status and messaging 
service for mobile and handheld amateur radio satellite users.  
Grade of service depends on user adherence to Power levels, 
transmission Period, and Precedence criteria.  (Both are currently 
not working to full design, so note changes below).

POLICY STATEMENT:

QIKcom-2 is an open system in accordance with the ITU regulations for 
the Amateur Satellite Service.  To provide the best overall 
throughput for the largest collection of users, the QIKcom-2 digi-
peater is protocol driven and requires that all users adhere to 
the fundamental protocol requirements.  Users that adhere to 
these published protocol and operating standards are very welcome. 
                                                                    
AGREEMENTS:

You may use QIKcom-2 if you adhere to the following agreements:

1) QIKcom-2 is for ATTENDED LIVE UI digipeating only.  No CONNECTIONS 
   either TO or THROUGH QIKcom-2 is authorized.  Unattended 
   operations are not welcome (except for validated experiments, 
   Antarctic WX stations and floating environmental buoys.

2) Keep informed of the current protocol requirements via the PCsat
   web page www.aprs.org/qikcom-2.html or via bulletins in the 
   downlink.  The requested 
   routine uplink rate is only 1 routine position/status packet 
   per minute.  One-line messages may be somewhat more frequent 
   in a dialog context. 

3) Your objective is to get mobile/HT position or
   status digipeated once or so per pass and to relay a few 
   messages or Email as needed.  Share the resource.  Minimize 
   your transmissions..

4) The QIKcom-2 digi responds to ARISS, APRSAT and WIDEn-N.
   With ISS on the same frequency and also suppoting these same
   generic aliases, using ARISS,ARISS or WIDE2-2 is recommended.
  
   Like the terrestrial network, QIKcom-2 does callsign-substitution 
   of its own MYCALL to indicate that it has digipeated the packet.
   The ISS does not do callsign insertion on WIDEn-N so ARISS is
   receommended if you want confirmation of digipeat via RS0ISS.

6) Use only the authorized power levels, channel and periodicity for 
   your station class and precedence as posted and published below.

   STATION CLASS   PWR  BAUD  UPLINK   PERIOD   DIGIPATH  DOWNLINK
   --------------  ---  ----  -------  -------  --------  ---------
   Base Stn Packet 50W  1200  145.825  2 min    APRSAT    145.825
   Base Stn DTMF   50W        145.TBD  1 min              145.825
   Handi-Talkie     5W  1200  145.825  various  APRSAT    145.825
   Handi-T  DTMF    5W        145.TBD  various            145.825

   QIKcom-2 can hear  a 5 Watt station using a decent antenna when
   no one else is colliding with the uplink.

7) Use the shortest possible packets.  Mic-E protocol or APRS
   compressed is preferred (typically 30 bytes or so).  ALso
   Use a short TX Delay (TXD) of about 150 ms or less if possible.
