AVRS NODE LIST FORMATS                                  8 Jan 2001 WB4APR
----------------------

When we get to the point of dumping multiple NODE status to the front panel
of the Kenwood radios I suggest a format that distinguishes between active 
and non-active nodes on the Kenwood summmary list.  It looks like this:

  +---------------------------------+
  |  1: AnaplsMD.   20:36  OBJECT   |
  |  2: BaltoMD .   20:36  OBJECT   |
  |  3: WashDC  .   20:36  OBJECT   |
  |  4: BullRnVA=   20:36  OBJECT   |
  |  5: SanFrnCA=   20:36  OBJECT   |
  +--------------------------------+

This display shows 5 out of the 40 list at a time and makes it easy to see
the status of multiple nodes in a dump from the local IRLP node (on its
own frequency). The 9th character of the object name indicates its status.

"$" means down  
"." means idle, 
"=" means connected  And the link is identified in the OBJECT text field
"?" means unknown, etc..

An advantage of the OBJECT format also is that it DOES allow a full 9
U/L case character NAME without the 6x2 LETTERxSSID requirement.  And also 
then the OBJECT format can convey any other APRS format and all the
varieties of information possilble for each nodes PAGE display.

Next problem is how to restrict the data dump of hundreds (will be
thousands before long) for the 40 you are interested in.

Do you request alphabetically starting with X
Do you request a LAT/LONG?
Do you request the nearest to X
Do you request only those in use?
etc..

I will add these thoughts to the AVRS ideas page tomorrow when I get a
chance:  http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/avrs.html
