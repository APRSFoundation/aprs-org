Automatic Voice Reporting System AVRS

AVRS is a generic term that applies to any Voice-over-IP system that
uses APRS to augment the end-user data delivery and display of system 
status and/or end-to-end signaling between users of these systems.  
Thus AVRS refers to all of the systems:

One early objective of AVRS is for IRLP, I-LINK, ECHO-Link and any
other Voice-to-Internet interfaces to HAM radio to transmit a status 
packet to local APRS users whenever the node changes state.  These status
packets show up on the front panel of APRS radios or other display devices
to alert APRS mobiles of the current state of all nodes in RF range.  
The normal APRS front-panel display can show the following information 
about a node:

NAME       Node geographic name or Node Number
State:     Off line, idle, in use, Connected, Conferenced.
Position:  Coordinates of Node
Distance:  Distance from mobile (computed by mobile)
Bearing:   Direction from mobile (computed by mobile) (an arrow)
Freq:      Frequency of node
PL:        PL of node if used or if public
Link:      Callsign or name of station connected
Type:      Type of Node, IRLP, I-Link, ECHOlink, etc

All of this is transmitted in a single APRS OBJECT (ITEM) packet by a TNC 
connected to the PC comm port. The node software simply has to send an 
ASCII string to the serial port whenever the node changes status.  A TNC 
connected to the serial port and a radio on 144.39 (USA) completes the 
hardware requirements.

NOTE:  Eventually we hope all NODES will convert to an alphabetic NAME
instead of a NODE number.  This is far more user friendly.  For example, 
of the node in Annapolis Maryland the name would be MDannapls and when
typed on a Touch-Tone DTMF pad, the equivalent node number would be

MDAnnapls  ==>  63266757

This way no one has to remember node numbers, just NODE names.  I call this
process "hashing" the name in to a DTMF string.  All nodes begin with their
two digit STATE or COUNTRY abbreviation.  But this will take evolution of
the existing system to include the additional digits necessary.  But in the
mean time, NODE operators can CHOOSE numbers that at least approximate their
Touch-Tone hash code of their geographic name.  For example, the node at 
NASA in Greenbelt Maryland could choose 6272.  Or Annapolis could choose an
echolink number of 26627.

INTERIM PLAN:
-------------

But until we get the IRLP or ECHOlink node systems to switch to alphabetic
node names, we will use the node TYPE and NUMBER for now.  Such as 
IRLP-7070 or ECHO12345

SAMPLE DISPLAYS ON THE TH-D7 HT for ECHOLINK NODE NAMED MDAnnapls:

+-------------+   This is the station list.  It contains the last
| 1:MDAnnapls |   40 entries heard.  It shows 2 nodes on line and
| 2:DCWash-03 |   one, MD-NASA as being connected.  You can tell
| 3:MD-NASA   |   it is connected because it is all UPPERCASE.
+-------------+   (But this is future objective)

+-------------+   This is how things will actually appear until we can
| 1:IRLP-7070 |   convince everyone to switch to node names.  Notice
| 2:ECHO12345 |   The node fits in the list just like any other APRS calls
| 3:WB4APR-9  |   heard.
+-------------+


+-------------+   Each time a new status comes in, it is displayed for
| 1:IRLP-7070 |   10 seconds as shown here.  It shows that it is
|  146895-107 |   on 146.895 MHz with - Offset and PL of 107.
|   OFF @1345 |   It is also the first display page for Station #1
+-------------+

+-------------+
| 1:IRLP-7070 |  This is page 3 showing the node is in FM19SX
|   FM19SX    |  and is 13.5mi east
|/L 13.5mi => |
+-------------+

+-------------+
| 1:IRLP-7070 |  This is page 5 showing the node is running
| pw49W h0400'|  about 50 watts to a 6 dB omni antenna at 400'
| ant6dB omni |  Normal APRS programs will display a range circle
+-------------+  computed from this information.

+-------------+
| 1:IRLP-7070 |  The state just changed to "connected to the
|  146895-107 |  node number 8315"
| => 8315     |
+-------------+

The Kenwood D700 mobile displays similar information, but because of its
larger screen, it displays it all on one page.

PACKET FORMAT:
--------------

The format of the string is in APRS "OBJECT" format as follows:

;nnnnnnnnn*DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDMM.HHWLPHGphgdFFFFFF+PPPyyyyyyyyyyzzzzzzzz

Where:
nnnnnnnnn           is the 9 character node Name or Callsign
DDMM.HHN DDDMM.HHW  is the LAT/LONG of the node
L                   is a the Link ICON character
"PHG" are required characters indicating the next 4 chars are:
                    p is power
                    h is HAAT
                    g is antenna gain
                    d is directivity
FFFFFF+ppp          frequency in KHz, offset, and PL in whole number Hz
yyyyyyyyyy          10 Status bytes (Second line on a TH-D7)
zzzzzzzz            8 optional bytes shown on the D700, but not the D7

Formats for the NNnnnnnnn Name or Callsign Field:
(When we get around to it)

   REPEATER:    Then NN is the state and nnnnnnn is the city
   INDIVIDUAL:  NNn is the type IR-, IL-, EC- and nnnnnn is call
   STATUS:      This is the key.  The CASE of this field
                indicates four operating states:
                uullllllll  - shows offline
                UUllllllll  - Shows on line or idle
                UULlllllll  - Shows Connected
                UULLLLLLLL  - Shows conferenced.

Formats for NODES using existing numbering schemes depend on the number
of digits.  Four and Five digit systems fit well.  As we go to larger
number of digits, then the leading TYPE characters can be shortened to
IP, EO, or IL, etc:
    IRLP-#### for four digit IRLP nodes 
    ECHO##### for five digit Echolink nodes
    I-LK-#### for I-Links
   
Formats for FFFFFF/ppp:  Notice that this is a 10 byte field driven
by the fact tht both the D7 and D700 display such text in a 10/10 format
for the D7 and a 10/10/8 format for the D700. The following variations
on this format are permitted:
    FFFFFF+ppp   Can show a + or - repeater offset.
    FFF.FFF-     Decimal point fits if there is no PL
    FFFFFF/ppp   Is simplex or no offset is given


Formats for the variable field YYYYYYYYYY and ZZZZZZZZ:  Again, the
YYYYYYYYYY field is 10 characters and is displayed on both the D7 and
D700, but ZZZZZZZZ is only displayed on the D700.  Therefore the
following formats are suggested.  Notice the leading space or punctuation
mark to make this more readable on devices other than the Kenwoods where
these fields are concatonated together in the actual packet:

   Node State   YYYYYYYYYYZZZZZZZZ   Comments
   ----------   ------------------   -----------------------------
   Offline:    " Off @HHMM........"  can contain some comments in Z
   On-Line:    " On  @HHMM........"  Time it returned to ON (+Z if any)
   Busy:       " Busy HHMM.3 nodes"  Time it went busy & # of nodes
   Connected:  "=NNnnnnnnn at HHMM"  Shows call/Name of connection
               "+NNnnnnnnn at HHMM"  if another one connects

TIMING:  The status packet should go out whenever the node changes state,
or once every 10 minutes.

PATH:  These packets should go DIRECT if the Node is physically
at the RF site, because the packet will have the same RF coverage area.
If it is necessary to hit a digipeater, then ONLY hit ONE HOP (via WIDE).
There will  be a lot of these packets and we dont want to kill the golden
goose by overloading the APRS system.  Keeping them DIRECT keeps any
QRM issues totally local..

APRS TNC PARAMETERS:  The TNC connected to the COMM port needs
to be in converse mode so that the ASCII string is transmitted
when it is sent to the COMM port.  These TNC settings are
recommended:

   MYCALL is your callsign.   It is not meaningful in AVRS
   UNPROTO APVInn VIA WIDE    For IRLP, with nn as software version
      or   APVEnn VIA WIDE    For ECHOlink
   BEACON EVERY 0             Turn off all beacons unless
                              you have a specific reason for on.

JUSTIFICATION:

IRLP, I-LINK and ECHOlink will revolutionize voice HAM radio just
like APRS and Steve Dimse's APRS-IS have revolutionized packet
radio.  APRS in this case is the end user data system for
delivering tactical real-time data to the mobile user  which is
of immediate value to him.  Kenwood has also made all this
possible by giving us a target end user display system to which
we can push this formatted information.

Now, this is only the beginning.  Here are the NEXT steps in the
evoluion:

NODE NAMING:
------------

The objective of AVRS is to be system transparent to everything
except the end user's callsign.  If I want to talk to WB4APR
by voice anywhere on the planet, then all I should have to do
is enter the callsign.  APRS should know where he is, IRLP/ECHO
link can make the connection, so we already have all the tools.
But, so that ANYONE can use the advantage of AVRS, not just
APRS mobiles, the obvoius comon denominator is the ubiquitous
DTMF pad.  This is why the TOuchTone system was developed for
APRS as APRStt.  But to facilitate callsign entry, APRStt
uses "Touch-Tone callsign hashing".  That is you simply spell
out the callsign on the Keypad.  Thus, every callsign has a unique
4 to 6 digit number hash.  Only about one call in every 1000
will have similar hash codes.  In those cases, the node simply
reads back all those that matched and are on line, and ask the
sender to select the right one.

For WB4APR, the HASHED call is 924277  This should be my ECHOlink
node number.

REPEATER NAMES:  Now, with 60,000 repeaters involved, the callsign
of a repeater means practically nothing outside of its supporting
club.  Thus, REPEATERS or LINKS that support multi-users should
use NAMES that either refer to the geographic location, or to the
name of the club.  Since APRS supports a 9 character packet call,
then these names must be limited to 9 characters as follows:

   NNnnnnnnn  Where NN is the STATE abbreviation in the USA/Canada
              Where NN is any other distinct 2 letter country code
     nnnnnnn  Is the City or other distinguishing  letter group.

For example, DCwash03 Might be the 3rd IRLP repeater in Washington DC,
MDnasa might be the repeater at the NASA Goddard center in Greenbelt
Maryland.  VAamrad might be the AMRAD repeater in Virginia.
Again, these NAMES automatically convert to a TouchTone HASH code.
In this case MDnasa is 636272  Or MD-NASA is 6306272

Phasing in these new node numbers is easy.  In APRStt, all HASH coded
callsigns are preceeded with a "0" to indicate it is a hashed call.
If it doesnt start with a "0" then it is an existing NODE number or it is
a fully spelled out callsign.  In this case, WB4APR on the TTone pad is
922444427A77 when fully spelled out.  The "A" key is a separator when two
adjacent letters are on the same TTone key.  The TTOne HASH plan is:

  QZ1   ABC2  DEF3
  GHI4  JKL5  MNO6
  PRS7  TUV8  WXY9
   *    _0     #

MULTIPLE NODES PER CALL:  Just like Packet allows up to 16 differnet
SSID's under a single callsign, the inventiveness of HAM radio operators
will require multiple uses per call.  Following on the ECHOlink definition
of -R and -L for Repeaters and links, this convention can be extended to
a total of 9 different stations subtypes.  Here we carefully make sure
there isa one-to-one correspondence to TTone keys so that we have no
ambiguity.  Here are my suggestions for the 9 station types:

KEY  LTR MEANING
---- --- -------
1QZ   Q  Qth
2ABC  C  Club station
3DEF  E  EOC or other emergency station
4GHI  H  HF station
5JKL  L  Link station
6MNO  M  Mobile station
7PRS  R  Repeater
8TUV  T  Telephone link (local calls)
9WXY  W  Work station


Thats all there is to it.  The result will be a revolution in
HAM radio, because now users can see on the tiny-web-pages of
their radio, the status of all nodes (known or unknown) that
are in range, no matter where they are.  And the Frquency,
PL and status are also shown.

Later we can add all the additional leveraging ideas that I have
been talking about for using APRS as an adjunct to VOICE Internet
interfaces to HAM radio..
