IPRS is an acronym to describe the potential of a marriage between
the global APRS digital network and the global Internet Radio
linking project.  Combining the first and last letters of IRLP
with the final three letters of APRS yields IPRS!

As APRS grew to global proportions in the late 90's through the
internet connectivity pioneered by Steve Dimse (K4HG), I began
looking for ways to add internet voice connectivity to APRS and
called it AVRS.  Over the same period, Dave Cameron's (VE7LTD)
Internet Radio Linking Project has risen to prominance world wide
by providing that same kind of global conectivity as APRS but with
voice.

Taking advantage of the voice connectivity of IRLP, recently we have
defined many ideas and APRS formats to be able to use APRS as an
adjunct data link to facilitate the end-to-end signalling between
end users of IRLP using APRS.  Further the mobile APRS data
displays make an excellent function for displaying IRLP network
data to the mobile user.  One of the ultimate objectives of the
APRS adjunct to IRLP is the ability of an APRS mobile user to
establish an end-to-end voice connection to any other amateur on the
planet with no other knowledge than his callsign.

Thus, the IRLP system and the APRS-IS (Internet System) could work
together to make the end-to end voice connection using the nearest
available IRLP nodes.  At the Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) National
convention in Vernon, BC on 26 July, I discussed this concept with Dave
Cameron and suggested we might define this marriage as "IPRS".  This
IPRS term will facilitate further discussions about this revolutionary
potential!  THe following is 3 phased approach could be used to
arrive at that ultimate objective.  The first is MANUAL, the second is
ASSISTED and the third is called AUTO-QSY.

MANUAL   - APRS user-to-user Call-back message. (Works now today!)

ASSISTED - Central IPRS server watches global IRLP and APRS-IS system
           and when seeing IPRS-CQ, sends APRS-QSY msg to BOTH users
           informing them both of the nearest not-in-use IRLP node
           numbers and freqs.  Users manually QSY and the caller
           establishes the IRLP link.

AUTO-QSY - End user's radio, on receipt of the APRS-QSY message, will
           AUTOMATICALLY QSY, and central IPRS server will automatically
           establish the IRLP node links!

The following paragraphs elaborate on the above phases and add
additional details to this concept.  

IPRS-NUMBERING SYSTEMS:  Also, we do need to account for the
large number of IRLP spin-offs exploding onto the landscape by using
a consistent numbering system across all applications.  The following 
APRS messages for now, could suffice for the users to send a call-back
message:

   IRLP:      CQ I####
   I-Link:    CQ L####
   EchoLink:  CQ E#####
   eQSO:      CQ Q#####

IPRS AHUBS:  And having IPRS work across a variety of voice systems also 
suggests that instead of IPRS trying to get inside of the internal link
status system of each type system, it might be better to ask all Voice
systems desiring to support APRS end users, to put out their IPRS status
into a COMMON APRS formatted internet IPRS clearing house channel...
An AHUB if you will..

In other words, we put up an APRS-INTERNET-HUB where all IPRS applications
simply send their current status in APRS formatted style packets.  This is
an OPEN AHUB, just like all the APRS hubs are and all IPRS applications 
can monitor this channel for end user node status for finding active and 
available nodes for IPRS requests.


DETAIL DESCRIPTIONS OF IPRS PHASES:

MANUAL -  APRS user sends simple message to another APRS user indicating
his call-back IRLP number.  APRS recepient initiates IRLP call back.
This works, NOW, TODAY!  The format of the APRS message is simply:

          From: WB4APR      To: VE7LTD      Msg: CQI #1234

The meaning is that WB4APR is asking VE7LTD to call him back on his
current IRLP node #1234.  The APRS message reaches VE7LTD no matter
where he is on the planet via the APRS-IS assuming he is on the
air.  On receipt, and if VE7LTD is available, he will establish the
call-back link.

ASSISTED -  A distributed IPRS server system monitors both the IRLP 
active node status and also the global APRS-IS stream looking for IPRS-CQ
messages.  On detection, it compares the positions of the users and the
nodes and identifies the nearest non-busy IRLP node numbers to each one.
If one of the nearest nodes is connected to a CONFERENCE node, then both
users are invited to join the conference in session. This reply message
to both end users is tailored to fit on each one's APRS message screen.

   APRS user:      67 character free field line
   TH-D7 HT user:  45 char line arranged as 12,12,12,9
   TMD700 user:    64 char line arranged as 22,22,21    <i need to ck this

EXAMPLES of the IPRS Messages sent to each user on the TH-D7 HT display:

   WB4APR sends APRS msg to VE7LTD saying "CQI" requesting an IRLP
   voice link.  IPRS distributed server responds with messages to
   to both users informing them of nearest nodes to each of them.

   Message to WB4APR (originator)
   +--------------+  +--------------+   Message confirms to sender that
   | CQ to VE7LTD |  | Use   I#1212 |   the IPRS processor has seen the
   | on IRLP 2323 |  |  146.995^PL  |   IPRS-CQ message and tells sender
   +--------------+  +--------------+   of his nearest IRLP node.

   Message to VE7LTD (called station)
   +--------------+  +--------------+   Message to recepient asks him
   | Call WB4APR  |  | Use   I#2323 |   to call the sender on his IRLP
   | on IRLP 1212 |  |  446.375^PL  |   number and suggests the closest
   +--------------+  +--------------+   node that he can use...

If either of the nearest nodes to either of the users is currently
connected to a conference node, then both users are informed of that
situation so they can join the conference.  The following message
would indicate that #2323 near the callee is on a conference node:

   Message to WB4APR (originator)
   +--------------+  +--------------+   Message confirms to sender that
   | VE7LTD bsy   |  | Use   I#1212 |   the IPRS processor has seen the
   | 2323 = C123  |  |  146.995^PL  |   IPRS-CQ message but tells sender
   +--------------+  +--------------+   his nearest IRLP node is busy
                                        but that it is currently con-
                                        nected to conference node #123

   Message to VE7LTD (called station)
   +--------------+  +--------------+   Message to recepient asks him
   | Meet WB4APR  |  | Use   I#2323 |   join the conference currently
   | on Conf  123 |  |  446.375^PL  |   in progress on his closest
   +--------------+  +--------------+   node that he can use...

   This same message would be sent to the originator if his nearest
   node was the one that was currently connected to a conference.
   

AUTO-QSY -  The ultimate IPRS implementation is when the end users radio
can respond directly to an IPRS command to automatically QSY to a given
link freuency.  This can be done through newly manufactured radios or
retrofitted to existing radios with a simple external pc-processor.  The
Pic processor watches for the QSY packet command on the serial port and
then sends the appropriated radio-control codes to set up the call.

Of course end users may enable various levels of auto-QSY to maintain
some level of control over their radio response to these external
influences.  QSY commands may come in as BULLETINS to all stations
in an area or as commands directed to only your station.  Such a menu
might consist of the following.  Each level is assumed to include
the processing of lower levels

   OFF  - No QSY commands accepted.  Displayed but not prompted
   1    - No QSY action, but prompt for Directed Commands
   2    - No QSY action, but prompt for all QSY commands
   3    - Respond to only Emergency Directed QSY Commands.
   4    - Include Priority Directed and above QSY commands.  
   5    - Include all Directed QSY commands.  Prompt for BLNS
   6    - Include all Directed QSY commands and Emergency Bulletins
   7    - Include all Directed QSY commands and Priority Bulletins
   8    - Auto-QSY to all

Since the kenwood D7 and D700 packet data can be monitored on the serial
port while in APRS mode, an external PIC processor can watch for QSY
commands and then command the radio as indicated.  Thus, this
IPRS automated QSY idea is backwards compatible!
