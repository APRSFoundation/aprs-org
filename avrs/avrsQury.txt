AVRS QUERIES:                                          8 Jan 2001 WB4APR
-------------

Someone write an AVRS info engine that will respond to Queries anywhere
in the world with the NODE number of the nearest node to callsign X and
the distance.

Query APRS message:    TO: W3XYZ  MSG: ?AVRS
AVRS Engine response:  TO: mycall MSG: #nnnn xx mi
                                       #nnnn xx mi

Notice the 12x12 character formatting of the response message to fit on
the 12x12x12x12 display lines of the D7.  AND the use of 4 digit node
names (we better start planning for it now!)

Notice, that since this is a message to individual W3XYZ, that individual
may also receive the Query as a message as well.  Thus he konws that
someone is looking for him as a freebee.

I will add these thoughts to the AVRS ideas page tomorrow when I get a
chance:  http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/avrs.html
