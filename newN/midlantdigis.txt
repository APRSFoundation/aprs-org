Mid Atlantic New n-N Paradigm Plan                           8 Dec 2004
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We must modernize APRS in the Mid-Atlantic region.  And it can be done
overnight by remote-digi-sysops, with little impact on existing users
and yet open up more efficient pathing and troubleshooting.  It is based
on the principles of the new n-N paradigm:

1) Long Chain Interstate ##LNKn-N chains
2) Continuing to support WIDEn-N where possible
3) 100% traceability of WIDEn-N to better tune the network
4) Full support of Mobiles using RELAY,WIDE, or SS2-2

These recommendations are based only on what I can see on the air from
Maryland.  Feel free to greatly extend these LINKS indefinately as far 
as the interstate goes!  This system fully supports the long haul traveler, 
AND reduces WIDEn-N QRM to the rest of us by a hundred-fold compared to
comparable WIDEn-N routing with abusive long paths.

The design is simple.  DIGI sysops have TWO GENERICn-N paths they can
support, UIFLOOD and UITRACE.  Simply drop WIDEn-N and replace it with
the local interstate ##LNKn-N and change the UITRACE paramter to your
state SSn-N which will be fully tracable and does not then need a
leading WIDE which causes more dupes.

UIFLOOD: 70LNKn-N PATPKn-N PATPKn-N PATPKn-N 81LNKn-N PATPKn-N 95LNKn-N
UITRACE: PATPKn-N PAn-N    PAn-N    PAn-N    PATPKn-N PAn-N    PATPKn-N

Interstate-70 70LNKn-N  Ohio to Baltimore
DIGIS:   WF8X-4   N3KTX-5  N3KTX-4  N3KTX-2  N3KTX-1
UIFLOOD: 70LNKn-N 70LNKn-N 70LNKn-N 70LNKn-N 70LNKn-N
UITRACE: PATPKn-N PAn-N    81LNKn-N MDn-N    95LNKn-N

Inter-Coastal-Waterway or EAST COAST COASTn-N Florida to NJ 
DIGIS:   WA4KXV   N4EVA-13 N4EVA-12 XXXXXXX- WX2NJ13  WX2NJ15
UIFLOOD  COASTn-N COASTn-N COASTn-N COASTn-N COASTn-N COASTn-N
UITRACE  VAn-N    VAn-N    VAn-N    VAn-N    GSPKYn-N GSPKYn-N

Notice that if you want to continue to support WIDEn-N for a while, please 
move it to the UITRACE parameter so that at least they are traceable.  
There is no need to trace the long-haul LINKn-N's because they are linear 
and we dont care what it takes to get there, because collateral damage is 
vastly reduced compared to all-directional-flooding like we used to have!

Remember, if you are not ready to go cold-turkey on WIDEn-N yet, you
dont have to, this is just adding a new capability and dropping the
old TRACEn-N which no one is using.  But if you are fed up with WIDEn-N
like I am, then please feel free to drop it now.

ALSO, all digis along an interstate Corridor do not need to support the
##LNKn-N, only enough to cover the long haul.  Where there is plenty
of overlap, this allows more flexibiitly for other state SSn-N's or
LANn-N's.

If you dont like this plan, then let us know your plan for reducing QRM.
But if you want to get control of our network so that it works locally
for users and low power trackers, then please lets get moving on this! 
Please report when these or other LINKS have been made so that we can
now PLAN OUR NETWORK instead of letting it just drown in uncontrolled
WIDEn-N flooding...

DIGIS marked with a * are actual!  All others are recommendations only.
This page will be updated periodically.  The neat thing will be that
once it is going, we can simply search FINDU for a MAP of every digi on
every chain! (as long as you put the name ie: 81LNK in the BText)

Be sure to also update your BLT's and LTPaths and PHG's and BEACONS
while you are at it.  See
