NEW-N PARADIGM SEETINGS FOR THE X-DIGI                     24 July 09
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated 24 July 09 to add additional beacons for EchoLink/IRLP objs
Original 16 Jul 09

Following settings for the TNC-S provider by Kai Gunter, LA3QMA.
Translated from  www.aprsla.net and tweaked by WB4APR...

The proportional pathing algortihm originally resulted in a schedule 
of data packets from the Digipeater which gave the mobile a local
direct digi packet every 10.5 minutes, a 1-hop digi packet every
31.5 minutes and a 2 hop packet every 63 minutes.  See the old
arrangement: www.aprs.org/mewN/X-DIGI-settings-old.txt

But this has been simplified to free up one more slot for another
local frequency object such as the EchoLink or IRLP object.  The
new result is:

A local digi packet every 10 minutes 
A 2 hop digi packet every hour
A local Frequency Object packet every 10 minutes direct
A local EchoLink/IRLP Object packet every 10 minutes direct

Here are all the settings for the TNC-X New-N Paradigm Digi:

L.     Set UIFlood Limit.               :7
T.     Set UITrace Callsign.            :WIDE
M.     Set UITrace Limit.               :3
1.     Set UICall 1.                    :

8.     Set UICall 8.                    :
D.     Set Dupe Time (x5 secs).         :3  (15 seconds)

B.     Set Beacons
0. Beacon Destination Call :APNX01
1. Beacon 1 Path :WIDE2-2             (via 2 hops)
2. Beacon 2 Path :                    (direct)
3. Beacon 3 Path :                    (direct)
4. Beacon 4 Path :                    (direct)

5. Beacon 1 inteval (x5 secs) :00720 Offset :0   (DIGI every 60m at 0) 
6. Beacon 2 inteval (x5 secs) :00120 Offset :48  (DIGI every 10m offset 4m
7. Beacon 3 inteval (x5 secs) :00120 Offset :72  (FREQ every 10m offset 6m
8. Beacon 4 inteval (x5 secs) :00120 Offset :96  (VOIP every 10m offset 8m

A. Beacon 1 text:!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.mmW#PHGxxxx W2, SSn-N comments
B. Beacon 2 text:!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.mmW#PHGxxxx W2, SSn-N comments
C. Beacon 3 text:;FFF.FFFxy*111111zDDMM.mmN/DDDMM.mmWrTnnn RxxM etc
D. Beacon 4 text:;EL-123456*111111zDDMM.mmNEDDDMM.mmW0FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn RxxM CALL-R

(Where W2, SSn-N shows the user the hops supported here
(Where FFF.FFF is the locally reecommended voice repeater
(Where xy makes it unique in the world
(Where Tnnn is the tone
(Where RxxM or Rxxk is the range in miles or kilometers
(Where etc is any additional data for users

Q. Quit

For a Fill-In digipeater set UICALL 1 to WIDE1-1 and set UIFlood and UITrace
empty.
