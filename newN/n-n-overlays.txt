DIGIPEATER OVERLAY CHARACTERS for the new N-N PARADIGM        5 April 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated 8 Nov 2007:

New n-N Paradigm digis should be labeled in a consistent manner for the 
benefit of the users.  The salient characteristics of the New-N-Paradigm
are the obsolescence of dupe-causing RELAY, WIDE, TRACE, etc paths, the
improved algorithms for DIGI Beacons, and trapping of large values of N
when using WIDEn-N paths.  Digis that implement these functions should be
clearly distinguishable from older obsolete digis with clearly labeled
overlays.  New-N Digis that support SSn-N routing should get an "S" 
overlay.  If for some reason they are limited and do not support the 
local SSn-N, then they may be an "L" overlay.   The old "F" overlay for
FLOOD digis is also obsolete, since we have now figured out how to make
these old version 8.2 KPC-3's work well with the New-N paradigm.

The next most important parameters in the digi position texts is the short-
hand describing the capabilities of the digi using Wn and SSn etc.  If we 
do these in a consistent manner, then users can easily see what to expect.  
Also remember the 10 x 10 x 8 byte display on many of the mobiles when 
editing your beacons for best display in the mobiles...  Here are the 
overlays:

N for WIDEn-N's      "R,W,Wn..."      The old OBSOLETE flooding WIDEn-N's
L for Limited WIDEn  "W2..."          W2 receommended. SSn-N not supported
S for State Systems  "W2, SSn-N..."   W2 recommended. Supports SSn-N
1 for FILL-IN DIGIS  "W1-1..."        For a FILL-IN WIDE1-1 only digi
1 for 1-hop enforced "11,22,21,33..." Such as LA, etc
P for PacComm digi   "11,22,21,33..." or what ever is in ALIASlist
A for Alt-Input digis"W2, SSn-N...    Alt-Input on 144.99
X for eXperimental

The OBSOLETE LEGACY Overlays are:

R  for RELAY only digis      <== OBSOLETE.  MYALILAS should be WIDE1-1 now
W  for WIDE or R,W digis     <== OBSOLETE.  Should be WIDE1-1 only
T* for PacComm TRACE digis   <== should be changed to "P"
F* for old KPC ver 8.2       <== should be updated to New-N as an "S"
U* for UIdigi       *Should use "S" (or "L") when updated to New n-N
D* for DIGI_NED     *Should use "S" (or "L") when updated to New n-N 

We do not need to distinguish UIDIGI and DIGI_NED anymore by Overlay, 
since they also can do the New N-N paradigm very well and we can tell 
their software type by the APNXXX in their UNPROTO TOCALL which should 
be APNU.. or APND..  But since DIGI_NED has additional features, be 
sure to put "DIGI_NED" in your comment text something like "PHGXXXX 
W3, SSn-N,  DIGI_NED  Capable... etc" so that it shows up well on the 
Mobiles who are the most likely of these users...

PACCOMM DIGIPEATERS:  The old Trace only digipeaters that used to use the
old "T" overlay can be re-programmed to be compatible with the New n-N
Paradigm.  In this case, their overlay should change to a "P" overlay.
These digipeaters should eventually be programmed with UIDIG-ROMS so
that they can support the full power of the New n-N Paradigm.

OLD WIDE and RELAY ONLY digis:  RELAY and WIDE are obsolete.  And many 
fill-in digis may no longer be needed as the QRM from the many many dupes
are eliminated.  But if a FILL-IN digi is required, it should only support
WIDE1-1 (and it should get a "1" Overlay and have W1-1 in its text)
