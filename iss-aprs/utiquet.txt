Subject: [amsat-bb] ISS UtIquette

ISS UtIquette:



UI digipeating from space has great potential for bringing live-human

QSO's back to digital satellites.  This mode was quite well exercised

during the last year of MIR giving many stations lots of operating

experience.  One lesson was...



Since TNC's and PC's can be rather tireless at sending packets, the

following rule of "ISS UtIquette" might be a good idea...



1)  If your station is attended, then operate in accordance with good

operating practice... Make packets as short as practical and share, and

use the minimum power necessary to communicate.... etc...



2)  If your station is unattended, put it in RECEIVE only mode.



3)  If you need to conduct special tests which might not fit either

category above, then please limit your ERP to 5 Watts or less.  This way,

your packet will probably not QRM anyone trying to work ISS; yet if the

channel is clear, it will get through.



ERP means Effective Radiated power.  This includes antenna gain.  Or said

another way, an HT on an OMNI, not on a BEAM... etc.  It WILL work "if the

channel is clear".  In fact, 1W has been shown to work on rare ocasions...



A summay of past and present UI digipeating in space can 
be found on http://aprs.org/astars.html



DISCLAIMER:  I have no official position with ISS, ARISS, or AMSAT and I

hope I am not suggesting something out of place....
