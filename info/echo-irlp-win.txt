This description has been pulled from the freqspec.txt file to make 
it easier to locate the formats exclusively used for Echolink and 
IRLP and WinLink.  Please refer to www.aprs.org/info/freqspec.txt

The goal is to make sure that travelers and APRS mobile operators 
everywhere have access on thier mobile displays to the local 
frquencies of immediate value to their operations.  This means these 
objects:

1) The local recommended travelers repeater aprs.org/localinfo.html
2) The local Echolink and IRLP frequencies (this file)
3) The local WinLink node for email access

APRS, is a single resource for identifying and locating amateur radio
operators on both a local and global scale.  Access to these other
frequencies anytime-anywhere via APRS objects is fundamental to our
overall communications objectives.

KEEP IT LOCAL!  These local frequency OBJECTS should ONLY be 
transmitted in the local RF area where they can be immediately used.  
Transmitting them any farther than DIRECT or one hop will just be 
SPAM in areas that cannot use them.

IMPLEMENTATION:  These objects are alreay being generated by the
central Echolink or Winlink sites or by a script added to your IRLP 
code.  These objects are then injected into the APRS-IS where they
have little value.  Their real value is when they appear back to RF
in your local area for your local node.  To get it on the air, you
must coordinate with your local IGATE operator to add the NAME or
CALLSIGN of your object to its "pass-to-RF" list.

EchoLink OBJECT FORMATS:
------------------------

EchoLink object names have the format of EL-123456 so that the node 
number can be easily seen on the station list of the mobile.  This is
important, since the mobile user has to have the node number to
activate a link.  Not the callsign of the node. The rest of the 
object uses the previous formats above to convey operating frequency 
and tone, and range.  Here is an example OBJECT for EchoLink nodes.

;EL-123456*111111zDDMM.--NEDDDMM.--W0FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn STTS CALL

The "STTS" is only a four byte field for the current stataus of the
node.  Maybe "busy", "link", "off_", "idle" etc.  The CALL is the 
callsiign of this node.

In the LAT/LONG fields the TWO hundredths digits are shown entered 
as SPACE bytes so that the object is transmitte as a one-mile 
ambiguity object.  Replace the two "--" bytes above with SPACES for 
it to work.  The E between LAT/LONG makes APRS display the EchoLink 
symbol.  It is hoped that a single central EchoLink server will 
generate these objects so that the only thing needed to get them on 
the air in a local area is to have the local IGate sysop to activate 
the local object by name for pass-to-RF.

ECHOLINK FORMAT USING MIC-E:  The Mic-E format is used by the Kenwood 
D710 radio and it adds frequency information in the status field as 
shown here:

MYCALL>LLLLLL,DIGI:'GGGCSD0E]FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn RXXm Ecolink node=

The LLLLLL is the latitude bytes, GGGCSD are the longitude and course
speed bytes.  The "0E" are the ECHOLINK Symbol bytes.  And the "]"
byte indicates this is a D700 series Mic-E and the "=" on the end
indicates it is the D710 version.  The "FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn RXXm" is the 
frequency and range format.  And "Ecolink node" is intentionally 
misspelled to fit nicely on the display of a D700.

IRLP OBJECT FORMATS:
--------------------

See the Scrip to add this to your IRLP node:
http://irlp.kc6hur.net/irlp_scripts.php

IRLP object names are similar and have the format of IRLP-1234 or
IRLP12345 if they ever go to 5 digits.  This format is so that 
the node number can be easily seen on the station list of the mobile.  
The rest of the object uses the previous formats above to convey 
operating frequency and tone, and range.  Here is an example OBJECT 
for IRLP: 

;IRLP-1234*111111zDDMM.--NIDDDMM.--W0FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn STTS CALL

In the LAT/LONG fields the TWO hundredths digits are shown entered 
as SPACE bytes so that the object is transmitte as a one-mile 
ambiguity object.  Replace the two "--" bytes above with SPACES for 
it to work.  The I between LAT/LONG makes APRS display the IRLP 
symbol.  It is hoped that a central server will be written for these 
objects as well so that they can be consistently generated into the 
APRS-IS and then only gated back to RF locally.  The STATUS (STTS)
can be something like these: (Idle, off_, busy, etc).  For more info, 
contact Mark Herson n2mh@n2mh.net

WINLINK OBJECT FORMATS:
-----------------------

WinLINK Telpac gateway object names have the format of W?-CALLSIGN 
(where W? can be WL or W1, W2,... W9 for multiple stations) so that 
the node callsign can be easily seen on the station list of the mobile.
The rest of the object uses the previous formats above to convey 
operating frequency and range.  The baud rate, "bbbb" for packet is 
inserted in place of the TONE, Txxx for voice. Here is an example 
OBJECT for injection into the APRS-IS:

;WL-AB9XYZ*111111zDDMM.--NWDDDMM.--WaFFF.FFFMHz 1200 RXXm comments

In the LAT/LONG fields the TWO hundredths digits are shown entered 
as SPACE bytes so that the object is transmitte as a one-mile 
ambiguity object.  Replace the two "--" bytes above with SPACES for 
it to work.  The W between LAT/LONG and "a" symbol makes APRS 
display the WinLink symbol.
