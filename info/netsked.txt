NET-SKED     A local FREQ OBJECT generator for APRS          7 Nov 08
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We need a background program (or add-on for Uiview) that will 
automatically output FREQUENCY objects LOCALLY every 3 minutes or so 
whenever an important local NET is in session.  This will show on 
everyone's mobile display to invite them to participate while the 
net is in session.  The format is carefully chosen to show up weell 
on the displays of the APRS radios.

   +------------+
   | NET-AARC   |      <== for the AARC radio club
   | FFF.FFFMHz |      <== the frequency of the net
   |  Tnnn Rxxk |      <== the tone and range in k or miles
   |  On-air    |      <== indicator of on air, or time
   +------------+

As an added option, during the day of the net, the object will also 
be transmitted once every 10 minutes but with the TIME instead of 
TONE and RANGE and "on air" as in the following example.  By using 
only two lines (beyond the object name) this will be sure to show on 
the display of even the limited D7.

   +------------+
   | NET-AARC   |      <== for the AARC radio club
   | FFF.FFFMHz |      <== the frequency of the net
   |  Today 9PM |      <== the tone and range in k or miles
   +------------+

Using this NetSked add-on, then, one person in each city can 
prepare a FILE for this add-on that lists all of the repeater 
nets and times, and frequencies and PATH so that the ADD-ON will 
then do all the work of putting out the objects on the correct 
schedule for all the clubs and events in the area.

REQUIREMENTS!

1) each net object should have its OWN PATH so that its packets 
only cover the area that is reachable by that net frequency.  Any 
of these packets that are delivered far out of the area are SPAM 
to everyone else and not appreciated!

2) Each net object should follow the format of the web page above

3) The rate during net-time should be settable.  But no higher 
than once every 2 minutes and no lower than every 10 during net 
time.?

4) The OPTIONAL "day-of" format with the weekly time should not 
be transmitted if it is aleady being properly transmitted by the 
local digi that should already be announcing the best locally 
recommended voice frequency.  See www.aprs.org/localinfo.html. 
But for secondary or rarely used repeaters that are not already 
covered on APRS, then this optional "day-of" announcement should 
be set for 10 minutes.

The need for this NET-SKED add-on is simple.

In my metropolitan area, there are over 100 ham radio clubs and 
100 repeaters.  It is impossible for anyone to remember when or 
where all of the weekly nets are.  But this is what APRS was 
designed to do.  TO make mobile operators aware of the "local 
situational awareness", so if he is mobile, and if a net is in 
progress, then he has an opportunity to tune in.  

Without these info packets, he might miss this opportunity.

Actually, the need is even more important than that!  With over 
100 clubs, and now activity falling for years, many nets are empty 
with no check-ins, because no one is out there listening.  Ham 
radio is dying and on way to make sure those of us remaining can 
participate is to use APRS to alert everyone that is mobile of any 
activity in progress.  We may not be as active on ham radio as 
before, but we are still out there driving... And would participate 
if we had "good situational awareness" (which APRS is suppposed to 
deliver).

SUGGESTED FILE FORMAT:

The fields needed in the schedule file that drives the NetSked engine
would be something like these:

NET DAY  NET TIME RATE NAME      FREQ    TONE RNGE PATH 
-------  -------- ---- --------- ------- ---- ---- -----------------
tuesday   9:30 PM 3/30 NET-AARC  147.105 none R17m VIA WIDE1-1
3rd Wed   7:00 PM 5/60 NET-MMARC 146.805 T107 R34k via W3AXY,WIDE1-1
2nd Mon  10:00 AM 4/45 NET-ARES  146.910 none R15m VIA W4ABC,WIDE1-1
etc

Beginning say 10 minutes prior, these packets are formatted into a
NET object packet with frequency and are transmitted at the high rate
for the duration indicated.  FOr example "3/30" indicates it will be
transmitted every 3 minutes for 30 minutes.  Values lower than 1 
minute andd greater than say one hour should probably not be allowed.

Ideally, the transmit algorithm might double the rate for the 10
minutes prior and first 10 minutes of the net before droping back to 
the indicated rate.  This accomplishes the same thing as the original
APRS decay algorithm, that is, to use high rates for new info, and
drop back for older lest valuable info.
