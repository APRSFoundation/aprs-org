APRS Freq Spec - AFRS(Automatic Frequency Reporting System)  30 Sep 2019
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  WB4APR
Revisions:

30 Sep 19 Added a section on D-STAR formats for Frequency Reporting.
          Added section on Yaesu radio incompatibilty with Freq Objects.

09 May 12 Clarified that Offset can always follow the Tone Tnnn format
          and is clarified as oXXX meaning +XXX or -XXX in 10's of KHz
          wherever Rxxm has frequently been shown in the examples when 
          the offset is not transmitted (standard offsets used).  IE, 
          that location following Tnnn can be either Rxxm or oXXX.

          The FTM-350 apparenlty does not decode FREQ OBJECTS.  The 
          suggested workaround is to continue to transmit standard
          FREQ Objects as before, and then add the FFF.FFFMHz for the
          locally recomended voice repeater as the leading part of 
          the local DIGI text.

08 May 12 Clarified a significant misunderstanding.  When the FREQ is
          transmitted as the OBJECT NAME, then there is no expectation
          of the first 10 byte FFF.FFFMHz field (except for crossband
          repeaters, and so the remaining fields do not begin in the 
          11th position, but begin at the start of the comment field.  
          Scan for clarifications with a search of "08 May".

          *** NOTE, a dual band APRS radio cannot TUNE or QSY to a
          cross band repeater anyway, without losing the APRS band!
          The information is in there for DISPLAY and INFO only.

07 May 12 Clarifies some wording.  IE, MHz should be case sensitive for 
          transmit, and insensitive for receive.  Also added comments 
          on observed inconsistanceis in the use of a leading space.
          Better enumerated the 4 format categories for FREQ info.  
          Removed the confusing 2nd-10-byte FFF.FFF + example due to
          confusion with the first 10 byte field where +/- are not
          allowed.

18 Jun 10 clarify 1750 Wideband and l750 narrow (l/c "L")
22 Oct 09 added WiRES and Echolink objects  
15 Jun 08 eliminate leading space in FREQ object
21 Feb 08 add WIDE/NARROW and TONE/CTCSS
13 Dec 07 updated IRLP beacon info
30 Sep 07 included Mic-E Echolink format for D710 radio
 1 Aug 07 merge in IRLP & EchoLink nodes (was on AVRS pages)
21 May 07 included unique ID's for repeater frequency objects
 8 Oct 05 Original concept

FREQUENCY IMPORTANCE IN APRS:

Ham radio's biggest advantage of thousands of frequencies is also its 
biggest stumbling block at rapidly and efficiently establishing com-
munications under emergent or immediate need or just to chat on a long
trip across country.  APRS provides a way to determine the operating 
frequency of the other stations and applications around us or to send
to a distant station, a desired contact frequency.  This initiative 
came out of the Hurricane Katrina lessons learned.

APRS, is a single resource for identifying and locating amateur radio
operators on both a local and global scale.  Over 30,000 stations 
world wide are currently in the system and you can view them in any 
area or near any station via any APRS client program or via any number 
of APRS web pages such as the following:

http://aprs.fi  OR
http://map.findu.com/callsign* ... and then select "stations near".
http://www.jfindu.net

FREQUENCY CATEGORIES:  There are basically four categories of Frequency
specifications in APRS:  

   FREQ OBJECTS - originated by local digis.  FREQ is the object name
   Fixed FREQ COMMENT - included in any fixed position or object comment
   FREQ STATUS - Frequency included in STATUS packets for NMEA trackers
   Auto FREQ INSERTION - automatically included in position comment

This APRS Frequency initiative is to standardize so that we know 
the correct frequency, Tone, offset, and maybe bandwidth.  In addition,
there are many other useful parameters that can be included in these
beacons as well.  These are the types of local objects that should show 
up on the mobile APRS display in every local area:

  Every mobile's (or fixed station's) operating frequency
  The locally recommended voice frequency for visitors
  The local IRLP or EchoLink node and current node status
  The local WinLink node and current node status
  The frequency of any Net in progress
  Any other local ham radio asset or net of interest to APRS mobiles

KEEP IT LOCAL!  These local fixed FREQ OBJECTS should ONLY be 
transmitted in the local RF area where they can be immediately used.  
Transmitting them any farther than DIRECT will not only add QRM and
congestion to the local channel they are also just SPAM beyond the
local simplex range in areas that cannot use them.  The sources of 
these frequencies  are as follows:

* Newer Mobile radios put their operating frequency in their STATUS 
  text (not to be confused with the APRS "STATUS" packet which is
  a separate packet and is not part of this FREQ spec.

* Local Voice Repeater objects are TX'ed by the local DIGI's TEXTS

* IRLP, EchLink and WinLink objects are generated by their own software 
  and injected into the APRS-IS.  From there, each LOCAL IGATE SYSOP 
  decides which IRLP and which Echlink and which WinLINK object is in 
  his immediate area, and he then adds these specific individual 
  objects to his pass-to-RF list via no more than a ONE-HOP-PATH...


RECOMMENDED TRAVELERS VOICE REPEATERS:

Every digi has a coverage area.  It is the responsiblity of that digi
to transmit an object showing the best recommended travelers voice
repeater in that coverage area, DIRECT, once-every-10-minutes.  Being
direct (no digipeats), they are only received in the vicinity where 
they are usable.  Also, by originating at the Digipeater's high site, 
there is no impact on the channel load, because the digi will not 
transmit until the channel is clear.  See:

     http://aprs.org/localinfo.html

WOTA, DX CLUSTERS, KATRINA:  This AFRS Frequency initiative is working 
in parallel with the post-Katrina ARRL Initiative to provide operating 
frequency contact information in support of emergency response.  

Since the APRS-IS exists worldwide and already supplies information on 
all APRS stations, it can also accept data from WOTA, DX clusters and 
Logging programs to serve as a single resource for finding the likely 
operating frequency of interest for any station. 

ADDING FREQUENCY TO APRS:  Already, APRS encodes the following 
information into typical user position packets.

  CALL, LAT, LONG, COURSE, SPEED (Grid is calculated)
  Station type (one of over 200 symbols)
  Antenna Height above average terrain
  Antenna Gain
  Comment (37 bytes max)  (usually where stations have their frequency)
  Software version

FREQUENCY has been added in a backwards compatible manner, either as a 
fixed formatted field in the first 10 bytes of the existing free-field 
position comment text or as the noun name of an object packet.

In addition to the frequency information (9 bytes of an OBJECT name) or
10 fixed format bytes in a position comment, there are additional 
optional format bytes to include additional amplifying information about 
tone, range, net and meeting times.  This information has been carefully
formatted to show up well on the 10x10 byte displays of the D7, D700's,
the HAMHUD, Yaesu's and other existing devices.   A typical entry might 
be:

"FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn +500 RXXm".  The Tone and Offset are fixed field formats
followed by additional text such as Range (XX miles or km).  If the 
offset is omitted, then the standard offset in the region will be used
by radios on receipt.   The tone does not include decimals.

FREQUENCY-in-MESSAGE:  Similarly we want to be able to send a freqency
in a message to another station, and for his station to either 
manually or automatically change his voice radio to that contact
frequency.  With this APRS capability, we can implement almost a
ham radio version of cell phones.  Just send a message to a distant
ham callsign and let the system set up the voice links. See the
http://aprs.org/avrs.html

FUTURE RADIO COMPATIBILITY:  In response to this frequency initiative
both Kenwood and Yaesu have released compatbile radios.  The Kenwood 
D72/710 and Yaesu FTM350 will automatically insert their frequency into 
their position text and on receipt, can parse it and automatically tune 
to that frequency with a single press of the TUNE/QSY button.   See the 
Automatic Voice Relay System:  http://www.aprs.org/avrs.html

RADIO INCOMPATIBILITY:  There are some radios (Yaesu) that will not
recognise the APRS Frequency Object that uses the FREQUENCY as the
OBJECT name.  Thus, drivers cannot simply see the Frequency in their
STATION LISTS.  Nor can they be sorted for easy summary at the top of
the list.  For these radios to see and react to the frequency object,
the frequency must also be listed in the comment field. THis greatly
limits the amount of data in these objects as the Frequency information
has to be included twice.

LOCAL/GLOBAL VOICE CONTACT VIA CALLSIGN ALONE:  One of the major
initiatives for this frequency capability was to be able to set up
end-to-end VOIP voice contact between amateur radio operators knowing
only callsigns.  By using APRS as the backbonen signalling system,
Automatic QSY can be implemented and this, combined with APRS 
messaging and IRLP or EchoLink networks can lead to fully automatic 
end-to-end voice connectivity between APRS users anywhere on the 
planet with only the knowledge of a callsign.  All it takes is a 
little software.  But that is where we are headed with this.


BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:  It is also possible that some PC controlled 
radios could be outfitted with simple external PIC processor that can 
interrogate the radios via their serial ports and can then insert 
their frequency information into their position beacon.  This could
easily be added to the firmware of some of the existing APRS TRACKER
devices.

NATIONAL VOICE ALERT FREQUENCY:  Presently, APRS operators already
have a nationwide voice contact frequency called VOICE ALERT.  This 
system for mobiles simply means that the APRS data radio is set to 
CTCSS 100 with the volume up.  This mutes all packets, but allows the
operator to be available for a voice call from anyone in simplex range 
running the PL 100 tone.  Most APRS built-in radios can do this
as is.  Any APRS mobile packet system can also do this if the TNC is
attached to the discriminator prior to the CTCSS squelch circuit.
But Voice Alert only works within simplex range.  That is why we also
need to see the stations other Voice band so we can contact him via
the repeater he is currently monitoring. 

See: http://aprs.org/VoiceAlert3.html

OTHER VOICE SYSTEMS:  All specialized local voice assets should also
beacon their operating frequency.  The three other global internet 
amateur radio linked systems, IRLP, EchoLink and Winlink also include 
provisions for beaconing their POSIITON and FREQUENCY data onto the 
national APRS channel using the FFF.FFFMHz format.  This way, mobiles 
monitoring the national APRS frequency anywhere in the country can 
be aware of the position and frequency of all amateur radio assets 
around them.


APRS FREQUENCY FORMATS:
-----------------------

There are two Frequency formats.  The POSITION/OBJ COMMENT format 
includes the frequency as FFF.FFFMHz in the free field text of a normal 
position or object report as noted above.  The other is called the
FREQ OBJECT format because it puts the Frequency in the OBJECT NAME 
using the format of FFF.FFxyz so that it shows up very clearly on the 
radio's positions/object list.  Of course, an object can also have a 
frequency in its position comment as well.  If both the object name and 
the comment contain a frequency, then the NAME is considered the transmit
frequency for the object and the frequency in its comment text is
its crossband or non-standard split receive frequency.

*** NOTE, [08 May] that a dual band APRS radio cannot TUNE or QSY to
          a cross band repeater anyway, without losing the APRS band!
          The information is in there for DISPLAY and INFO only.

As noted before, a 10x10x+ format is used for the POSITION COMMENT
format for best display on the existing variety of APRS radios.  Here 
are the standard 10-byte formats.  Please note that spaces are 
required where shown.  In some cases a "_" may be shown for clarity 
in this document, but in the actual format, a SPACE should be used:

CLARIFICATION 08 May 2012:  Note, if the FREQ is in the object name, 
(not in the first 10 bytes of the "comment") then the remaining
comment text (such as TONE and OFFSET, etc) are left justified in the 
comment field.  Examples for a FREQ OBJECT named FFF.FFxyz:

   Example object comments
   -----------------------
   Tnnn oXXX Rxxm ... Tone, Offset +xxx or -xxx, and or range
   Tnnn Rxxm ...      Tone and Range
   Tnnn ...           Tone only (radios will use standard offsets)
   Tnnn -000 ...      Tone and forced simplex
   tnnn oXXX ...      Tone and offset and Narrowband
   1750 oXXX ...      Tone Burst with offset
   l750 oXXX ...      Tone Burst & narrowband (Leading lower case L)
   

EXAMPLE POSITION/OBJECT comments when OBJECT NAME is not FFF.FFxyz:

   1st 10-BYTES  Frequency Description
   ----------    -----------------------------------------------------
   FFF.FF MHz    Freq to nearest 10 KHz
   FFF.FFFMHz    Freq to nearest  1 KHz
    
   Examples:
   146.52 MHz Enroute Alabama
   147.105MHz AARC Radio Club
   146.82 MHz T107 AARC Repeater (Tone of 107.2)
   146.835MHz C107 R25m AARC     (CTCSS of 107.3 and range of 25 mi)
   146.805MHz D256 R25k Repeater (DCS code and range of 25 km)
   146.40 MHz T067 +100 Repeater (67.8 tone and +1.00 MHz offset)
   442.440MHz T107 -500 Repeater (107.2 tone and 5 MHz offset)
   145.50 MHz t077 Simplex       (Tone of 77.X Hz and NARROW band)

   2nd 10-BYTES  Optional Added fields  (with leading space)
   ----------    -----------------------------------------------------
   _Txxx RXXm    Optional PL tone and nominal range in miles
   _Cxxx -060    Optional CTCSS tone and -600 KHz offset
   _Dxxx RXXk    Optional DCS code and nominal range in kilometers
   _1750 RXXk    Optional 1750 tone, range in km, wide modulation
   _l750 RXXk    Optional 1750 tone narrow modulation (lower case L)
   _Toff -000    Optional NO-PL, No DCS, no Tone, forced simplex
   _Txxx +060    Optional Offset of +600 KHz (up to 9.90 MHz)
   _Exxm Wxxm    East range and West range if different (N,S,E,W)
   _txxx RXXm    Lower case first letter means NARROW modulation
   _FFF.FFFrx    Alternate receiver Frequency if not standard offset

If a frequency is included in the first 10 bytes then "MHz" in mixed 
case is required to be transmitted.  (Case should be case insensitive 
on receipt to allow for manual typos).  Notice that the second 10 byte 
fields begin with a SPACE shown above as "_" (9 useable bytes) for 
better reading of the packet when combined with a frequency in the first
ten bytes.  Do not include the "_" but put a SPACE there in your actual 
packet.  (8 May 2012 clarification: if the first 10 bytes do not 
contain a frequency, then left justify the TONE and OFFSET without
the leading space).  Here is the raw packet format for the comments:
    
    FFF.FFFMHz comment...           one frequency
    FFF.FF MHz FFF.FFFrx comment... for separate TX and RX 
    FFF.FF MHz T107 R25m comment... for TX, tone and range
    FFF.FF MHz T107 oXXX R25m ...   for TX, tone and range
    Tnnn oXXX R25m comments....     for a FREQ OBJ <08 May clarity>
    Tnnn R25m comments....          for a FREQ OBJ standard offsets
    Tnnn comments....               for a FREQ OBJ Tone only


The 10x10x8 byte format has been defined so that it shows up well on 
the TH-D7, TM-D700 and Hamhud displays.  Examples are as follows:

    +------------+    +------------+    +------------+
    | >WB4APR-11 |    | >WB4APR-11 |    | >147.105md | <08 May clarity
    | FFF.FF MHz |    | FFF.FFFMHz |    | T107 +060  |
    |  FFF.FFF M |    |  T107 R17m |    | R25m text. |
    +------------+    +------------+    +------------+

OTHER COMBINATIONS:  It is important to note that the TEXT field used
for this frequency already has several possible options.  Normally
the comment-TEXT field begins after the SYMBOL byte.  But there are 
already several defined 7 byte Data-Extensions that then push the 
comment-TEXT field further to the right as shown here.  In many 
applications, an optional delimiter is added to make the packet more
readable.  This optional delimiter (usually a " " or "/") is not
explicitly called out in the spec, but should be considered in all
following parsing of the text field.  All of these can be valid use 
of Data-Extensions and following FREQUENCY info.

!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.MMW$FFF.FFFMHz ...         begins after symbol ($)
!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.MMW$CSE/SPD/FFF.FFFMHz ... 
!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.MMW$PHGphgd/FFF.FFFMHz ... 
!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.MMW$DFSshgd/FFF.FFFMHz ... 
!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.MMW$DFSshgd FFF.FFFMHz ... with SPACE insted of /
!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.MMW$CSE/SPDFFF.FFFMHz ...  w/o delimiter
!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.MMW$PHGphgdFFF.FFFMHz ...  w/o delimiter

LEADING SPACE ISSUE:  Althout the optional delimiter shown here is 
a "/" it can also be a SPACE character too. The original intent of 
APRS was that any free text field that begins with either of these
two delimiters, then they can be ignored and the beginning of the
text field begins after them. We believe that Kenwood and maybe
others did not allow for this option, and so a leading space will
not work.  We are trying to clarify this.... now in 2012...

FREQUENCY ON GPS TRACKERS:  APRS was intended to be a two-way 
comunications system between human operators.  For this reason, 
transmit-only tracking devices should include their monitoring voice 
frequency in their packet beacon so that they can be contacted.  The 
format is the same.  Simply put the frequency in the position text.
If the the tracker does not have that flexibility (such as a NMEA 
tracker, or Mic-E), then put the frequency into the STATUS BEACON 
text with the leading ">" STATUS formatter (not required in Mic-E):

 BText >FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn oXXX etc......

Where the leading ">" makes this packet an APRS STATUS packet and
the "etc..." can be any additional free text (or Tnnn tone) as
needed.  On recepit, most APRS programs should combine this info
with the station data to make the frequency parseable as needed.

D-STAR STATION FORMATS:
------------------------

To make a voice call with D-STAR station that uses D-STAR repeater,
the callsign of the accessing repeater is needed.  On the other hand,
to make a voice call with D-STAR station that does not use a D-STAR 
repeater, the frequency of the station's voice channel is needed.  
Here are the examples for D-STAR QSY information.

Communication without using a repeater station:
 1) FFF.FFFMHz D-STAR comment...

Communication using a repeater station:
 2) FFF.FFFMHz D-STAR>CALLSN A comment...
 3) D-STAR>CALLSN A comment...

1st 7-BYTES  means D-STAR station format.
2nd 8-BYTES  "CALLSN A" means the callsign of access repeater
             "CALLSN A" is fixed 8 characters.

(The optional "oXXX" (SHIFT/OFFSET) information is available between
 "FFF.FFFMHz" and "D-STAR")


RECOMMENDED VOICE REPEATER FREQUENCY OBJECTS:
---------------------------------------------

Please see: http://aprs.org/localinfo.html

OBJECT NAMES:  Every New-N Paradigm APRS digipeater is supposed to 
periodically transmit an OBJECT showing the locally recommended 
voice repeater frequency for travelers visiting the digi's own coverage
area.  APRS software should be able to locate these frequencies as 
well.  The format for these frequency object names is as follows:

    OBJECTNAME
    ----------
    FFF.FFF-z   5KHz repeaters with up to 62 unique (z) ID's
    FFF.FFFyz   5KHz repeaters with up to 2700 unique (yz) ID's
    FFF.FF-yz  10kHz repeaters with over 3600 unique (yz) ID's
    FFF.FFxyz  10kHz using three xyz unique characters...

Choose letters to make your repeater frequency unique in all the world
so that it can be easily found by wildcarding the callsign FFF.FF*.  

The rest of the OBJECT format contains the TONE and RANGE and any
specific information on regular net times and meeting dates.  The
format for these FREQ OBJECTS is:

;FFF.FFFxy*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrT079 R25m NETxxxxxx MTGxxxx...
;FFF.FFFxy*111111zDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWrT079 oXXX NETxxxxxx MTGxxxx...

(15 Jun 08 change.  Eliminated the leading space before the T079)

Where T079 is a tone of 79.7 Hz   (always drop the tenths)
Where R25m is a Range of 25 miles (or k for km)
Where oXXX is an offset in 10's of KHz +XXX or -XXX
Where NETxxxxxx is something like "Net Tu9PM" or "Net Tu730"
Where MTGxxxx  is something like "Mg3rdTu" and must be 7 bytes
Where ... 9 more bytes are possible but won't show on mobiles

These may at first appear very cryptic, but as a standard, they will
become second nature.  THe goal is to put as much standard info into
the minimum text that will fit nicely on the 10x10x8 displays of the D7, 
D700 and HAMHUD and on the 20 byte displays of the VX-8R and FTM-350.

TONES and DCS:  We force the tone to 3 bytes always for simplicity 
of display, since all tones are standardized, they do not need the 
tenths.  So T088, C067, T156 and DXXX are all valid entries.  Lower 
case implies NARROW modulation as in t088, c067, t156 etc.


OBJECT NAME PERMANANCE:  Notice that an object name needs to be 
unique since there are dozens of 146.94 repeaters in the country, 
and so these objects choose characters for the optional z, yz and 
xyz characters above to make them unique.  

Since these can be upper and lower case and or numbers, this gives 62 
unique identifiers for the 5 KHz repeaters and over 3600 for 10 KHz 
repeaters.  If there are still conflicts, then other delimiters such 
as "_=!^@, etc" can be used in place of the - separator.  But always
check to see if they get through on FINDU.COM using the link below.
For example, FINDU.COM does not display FREQ OBJECTS that use the
(+) character.

To see what freqeuncies are already in use, simply do a wildcard (*)
on the end of the FREQ in your favorite APRS-IS web engine.  For 
example, http://map.findu.com/146.94* will provide a list of all 
146.94 repeaters currently showing on APRS and their "xyz" modifiers 
currently in use!

These objects are transmitted with the pseudo permanent date/time 
stamp of 111111z.  This unique time stamp declares this object to be 
permanent.  This means that it should not be replaced by any other 
similarly named object unless that object is transmitted by the same 
originating station.  This lets the originator of a permanent object 
update or move his object, but it then prevents his object from being 
replaced by anyone else's similar object.

DX CLUSTER FORMAT:  APRS also decodes the DX CLUSTER format, and this 
format includes a frequency field too.  All APRS software should 
decode and capture this frequency information also.


THE NEXT SECTION IS ALSO FOUND IN: www.aprs.org/echo-irlp-win.txt)

EchoLink OBJECT FORMATS:  
------------------------

EchoLink object names have the format of EL-123456 so that the node 
number can be easily seen on the station list of the mobile.  This is
important, since the mobile user has to have the node number to
activate a link.  Not the callsign of the node. The rest of the 
object uses the previous formats above to convey operating frequency 
and tone, and range.  Here is an example OBJECT for EchoLink nodes.

;EL-123456*111111zDDMM.--NEDDDMM.--W0FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn STTS CALL...
...............   <== up to a max of 43 total characters

The "STTS" is only a four byte field for the current stataus of the
node.  Maybe "busy", "conf", "off_", "idle" etc.  The CALL is the 
callsign of this node.  But we dont get the RANGE info.  So maybe:

;EL-123456*111111zDDMM.--NEDDDMM.--W0FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn oXXX %CALL..
...............   <== up to a max of 43 total characters

Where % is a single byte to indicate Status.  This will show with
all of the information on teh front panel of the APRS mobiles as:

+------------+
| EL-123456  |
| 438.700MHz |
|  Tnnn Rxxm |
|  %CALL..   |
+------------+

The only loss is that the -R or -L does not show for most node 
callsigns unless they are four character calls.  Though this is
not needed by the mobile operator


POSITION DETAILS:  In the LAT/LONG fields the TWO hundredths 
digits are shown entered as SPACE bytes so that the object is 
transmitted as a one-mile ambiguity object.  Replace the two 
"--" bytes above with SPACES for it to work.  The E between 
LAT/LONG makes APRS display the EchoLink symbol.  It is hoped 
that a single central EchoLink server will generate these objects 
so that the only thing needed to get them on the air in a local 
area is to have the local IGate sysop to activate the local 
object by name for pass-to-RF.

ECHOLINK FORMAT USING MIC-E:  This format is for the Kenwood D710 
radio which reports its position in Mic-E format.  This format
will appear on the air as:

MYCALL>LLLLLL,DIGI:'GGGCSD0E]FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn RXXm Ecolink node=

The LLLLLL is the latitude bytes, GGGCSD are the longitude and course
speed bytes.  The "0E" are the ECHOLINK Symbol bytes.  And the "]"
byte indicates this is a D700 series Mic-E and the "=" on the end
indicates it is the D710 version.  The "FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn RXXm" is the 
frequency and range format.  And "Ecolink node" is intentionally 
misspelled to fit nicely on the display of a D700.

IRLP OBJECT FORMATS:
--------------------

See the Scrip to add this to your IRLP node:
http://irlp.kc6hur.net/irlp_scripts.php

IRLP object names are similar and have the format of IRLP-1234 or
IRLP12345 if they ever go to 5 digits.  This format is so that 
the node number can be easily seen on the station list of the mobile.  
The rest of the object uses the previous formats above to convey 
operating frequency and tone, and range.  Here is an example OBJECT 
for IRLP: 

;IRLP-1234*111111zDDMM.--NIDDDMM.--W0FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn oXXX STTS CALL...
...............   <== up to a max of 43 total characters

In the LAT/LONG fields the TWO hundredths digits are shown entered 
as SPACE bytes so that the object is transmitte as a one-mile 
ambiguity object.  Replace the two "--" bytes above with SPACES for 
it to work.  The I between LAT/LONG makes APRS display the IRLP 
symbol.  It is hoped that a central server will be written for these 
objects as well so that they can be consistently generated into the 
APRS-IS and then only gated back to RF locally.  The STATUS (STTS)
can be something like these: (Idle, off_, busy, etc).  For more info, 
contact Mark Herson n2mh@n2mh.net


WiRES OBJECT FORMATS:
------------------------

Yaesu WiRES nodes should also appear on the APRS channel.  For example
for an OBJECT NAME : WIR-1101D the format would be:

Example:  WiRES Node Number = "1101D" (Lat:3348.43N/Lon:11802.32W)

;WIR-1101D*111111z3348.43NW11802.32W0430.900MHz D023 oXXX STTS...
...............   <== up to a max of 43 total characters

If an FTM-350 Radio is used as the WiRES node, then it will identify
using the Mic-E format and should use this format:

MYCALL>LLLLLL,DIGI:'GGGCSD0W`FFF.FFFMHz Tnnn oXXX WiRES node _"


WINLINK OBJECT FORMATS:
-----------------------

WinLINK Telpac gateway object names have the format of W?-CALLSIGN 
(where W? can be WL or W1, W2,... W9 for multiple stations) so that 
the node callsign can be easily seen on the station list of the mobile.
The rest of the object uses the previous formats above to convey 
operating frequency and range.  The baud rate, "bbbb" for packet is 
inserted in place of the TONE, Txxx for voice. Here is an example 
OBJECT for injection into the APRS-IS:

;WL-AB9XYZ*111111zDDMM.--NWDDDMM.--WaFFF.FFFMHz 1200 oXXX comment
...............   <== up to a max of 43 total characters

In the LAT/LONG fields the TWO hundredths digits are shown entered 
as SPACE bytes so that the object is transmitte as a one-mile 
ambiguity object.  Replace the two "--" bytes above with SPACES for 
it to work.  The W between LAT/LONG and "a" symbol makes APRS 
display the WinLink symbol.
 

MICROWAVES:  Of course FFF.FFFMHz only works to 999.999 MHz, and so 
we have defined some letter designations above that.  There are two 
methods.  One, is to simply use GHz as in XXX.XXXGHz.  But this is 
limited to wideband modes to the nearest MHz.  Example is
__1.296GHz for 1296 MHz.  But to retain one KHz resolution, we use
this table of alphabetical extensions:

A96.000MHz would be 1296 MHz
B20.000MHz would be 2320 MHz
C01.000MHz would be 2401 MHz 
D01.000MHz would be 3401 MHz
E51.000MHz would be 5651 MHz 
F60.000MHz would be 5760 MHz 
G30.000MHz would be 5830 MHz
H01.000MHz would be 10,101 MHz
I01.000MHz would be 10,201 MHz
J68.000MHz would be 10,368 MHz 
K01.000MHz would be 10,401 MHz
L01.000MHz would be 10,501 MHz
M48.000MHz would be 24,048 MHz 
N01.000MHz would be 24,101 MHz
O01.000MHz would be 24,201 MHz


APRS FREQUENCY-IN-MESSAGE FORMATS:  A variety of formats have been 
proposed, but until someone is ready to implement either the auto-
QSY on receipt of a message, or to transmit such a message, it is
premature to nail down an exact format.  But something like:

QSY FFF.FFFMHz! ... Auto QSY now
QSY FFF.FFFMHz? ... Auto QSY unless user hits NO
QSY FFF.FFFMHz. ... QSY if user manually hits TUNE


CONCLUSION:   Examples of frequency use in APRS are obvious:

   1) Advertising the voice frequency you are monitoring
   2) Voice repeater and other local frequency Objects
   3) Mobile GPS map display of surrounding frequency assets
   4) IRLP and EchoLink nodes
   5) WinLINK Packet nodes
   6) EOC operations
   7) Long distance travelers
   8) ATV repeaters and links, etc...

Since the object of APRS is to facilitate local communications and 
situational awareness of all surrounding ham radio assets, everyone is 
encouraged to include their operating frequency in their position 
packets to make their availability known.
