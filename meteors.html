This MS Email page is a new direction from the 
<A HREF="APRS-docs/METEOR.TXT"><B>original METEORS.TXT documentation</B></A>. The bursty
mode of APRS works well with Meteor communications, but we dont see these long shots
on 144.39 because the channel is busy most of the time and maskes these gems.  Also,
6 meters works so much  better that that is where the greatest success is and because
it is normally a quiet frequency.  But 2m works too if you go to a quiet freq.  Remember
MS works all the time year round 24/7/365 with openings of a few seconds every few hours.
Of course this improves dramatically during meteor showers, but the routine is also
there.
<P>

<B>METEOR SHOWERS:</B>  Anytime, and especially during meteor showers tuen to these
frequencies and if you have a beam point to distance population densities about 600 to 12000 miles away, set your beacon to a HIGH rate and capture any packets you receive.  Overnight
is the best time for meteors.  Check your log and see what you got.
<P>

<B> 50.620 MHz 6 meter MS channel
<BR> 147.585 MHz 2 meter MS channl </B>
<P>

Six meters is about 10 times better than 2 meters, but both can work.  Th original 
APRSdos had a METERO mode built in that would send continuous packets for 15 seconds
out of every minute on schedule with the four quadrants of the country, and then
listen for the other three quadrants for the other 45 seconds.  But without that kind
of systematic control, you can also just set your beacon rate to 10 seconds and
see what happens.  Check  your log the next morning.

SPECIAL 6m PROJECT PROPOSAL:</B>  The operational scenario for this project is a minimal email
capability out of an area for First Responders back to the internet.  . Maximum
wait times on the order of a minute or less should be possible.
. This capability would be available immediately before phone lines, internet, 
satellite, and other wireless infrastructure
are re-established.  An example would be mobile units enroute and arriving in
the Katrina disaster area.  This Meteor Scatter basic communications link
would give them this low data rate, but reliable channel.</B>

The self plotting of APRS packets and global connectivity of
the APRS-Internet System (APRS-IS) makes it ideal 
for an Emergency Meteor Scatter Email System. . 
Using 100 Watt 6 Meter radios and standard AX.25 packet, it should be possible
to send outgoing APRS short text-message Emails and position/status reports
 reliably. . There are several key factors making this possible.
<P>

<LI> Meteor Scatter is long term reliable for a few packets per minute average throughput
<LI> Meteor Scatter ranges provide good coverage between 500 to 1000 miles
<LI> 6 Meters is an ideal HAM band for Meteor Scatter
<LI> Meteors are continuous, but generally 3 times better at 8AM than PM, and 4 times better in July than Feb.
<LI> Surplus 
     <A HREF="meteors/radio-set.JPG"><B> 100 watt 6m radios</B></A> are readily available 
     and innexpensive 
     <A HREF="meteors/6mRadios-all.JPG"><B>See stack of 100 of them</B></A>
<LI> APRS Internet connected Gateways are found everywhere all over the USA
<LI> Adding a 6m receiver at many IGates would immediately provide the Email-Receive capability
<LI> MS paths are very spot specific, so multiple receivers greatly increases receipt probabilities
<LI> The Automatic Email delivery system (WU2Z) is built-in to the APRS system and reliable
</B>

<P>
The map below only shows the receiver gain plots from 5 possible IGates, but it
is easy to visualize how dozens of IGates with their own coverage areas could
blanket the USA with Meteor Scatter Receive sites. . I only used five to keep
the map from being too cluttered.  Hopefully we would enlist dozens of 6m
monitoring IGates. . It is this large distribution of receive sites that
multiply the usually low probabilities of Meteor Scatter communication up
into the useful range of a few packets per miunte. . This is an IDEAL APRS
project beacuse the entire infrastructure exists already.
<P>

<P>
<B>ANTENNAS:</B> . Although the meteor scatter path is long term reliable,
the signals are weak when they do occur, so high gain antennas are desireable.
. Fortunately, a high gain antenna (in one fixed direction) can be errected
as easily as stringing a long wire antenna. . Some EZNEC models are shown
below.  The first plots are for a 200' piece of wire over perfect ground.
. It is missleading because the AZ plot is showing the Main beam but it is up
at 18 degrees which is not very good for MS.  The gain lobe is really a cone
around the wire.
<P>

<IMG SRC="meteors/longwire1AZ.GIF">
<IMG SRC="meteors/longwire1EL.GIF">
<P>
The next plots, the length is reduced to a more realistic 120 foot long wire 
and a <B> real</B> ground which absorbs energy.  Also, in the next model, the
backward wave is canceled with the
terminating resistor.  This resistor does not impact forward gain, but
eliminates standing waves and the backward lobe making the tuning much easier.
. This plot is also a lower elevation slice and so the two lobes of the
cone are more visible.  
<P>
<IMG SRC="meteors/longwire2AZ.GIF">
<IMG SRC="meteors/longwire2EL.GIF">

<P>
The
wire is fed 1/4 wave from one end with a series 1/4 wave section of two
 70 Ohm line lines
to match the 400 ohm impedance of the long wire.  One quarter wave from
the far end, a 400 ohm resistor suitable for half the TX power is located
to absorb energy in the unused direction making this a unidirectional wire.
For stations in the middle of the country, the resistor is not needed
since a bidirectional antenna would be desirable.  But without the resistor,
there are standing waves, and tuning is more critical.
<P>
<IMG SRC="meteors/longwireModel.GIF">  
<IMG SRC="meteors/Matching.GIF">  
<P>
The map below shows why the use of a long wire antenna gain will work well for
Meteor Scatter because we do not need gain exactly along the line between two
stations, we just need their gain patterns to be illuminating the same
part of the sky no matter where it is. . In this plot, the two major lobes
show very clearly because this is taken at a 5 degree elevation slice.

<B>Radios:</B> . Mike Chisena, KB2ZEV of the AMRAD club has found a source of 110 
Watt radios and is painstakingly converting each one to 6 meters for possible use in this
projct.  Here is a photo of a complete radio set (and the stack it came from):

<P>

The map below shows the successful reported packets during the 1995 persieds
meteor shower. . Although meteor showers show improved performance, the plot
below is for 2 meters, and the results on 6 meters is usually an order of
magnitude more sucessful.  This balances out well with routine meteor activity
which is active 24/7/365. . By transmitting the outgoing email repeatedly over
10 minutes or so, the successful reception by an IGate somewhere is virtually
guaranteed.

If you want more proof that Meteor Scatter works for APRS and to see easy
ways to monitor for packets, please see the original
<A HREF="meteorsB4.html"><B>original APRS meteor Scatter documentation</B></A>, 
and the original APRS <A HREF="APRS-docs/METEOR.TXT">METEOR.TXT</A> file for details.
There was also a write-up about the first <A HREF="APRS-docs/LEONIDS.TXT">LEONIDS.TXT</A>.

<P>

<B>DEVELOPMENT PLAN:</B>  . Here is a possible course of action to develop
this meteor scatter communications network.
<LI> First we need to add as many TNC and 6m receivers to IGates as we can muster up.
<LI> These will work as is with existing IGate software for getting Emails out.  . Done!
<LI> We need some special IGate code to be able to transmit back messages to MS back to the area.
<LI> This code will receive APRS-IS messages, and then schedule each IGate to
     continuously transmit the message for 5 minutes or so.
<LI> We need to determine the optimum sheduling algorithm.  
<LI> The original APRSdos was the typical 15 sec TX and 45 sec REC based on the
     quadrant of the country.

<P>
<B>EMAIL PROTOCOL:</B> . The protocol for sending email via APRS is well established
and operational. . This was developed by the Sproul Brothers and runs on a 
computer at Rutgers University that monitors the global APRS internet channel
and pulls out any messages addressed to EMAIL.  It wraps them in a standard
internet mail protocol and injects them into the normal Email system.  The format
is simply:
<P>
<B><i>
WB4APR>APRSxx::EMAIL____:XXXXXX@YYYYYY.ZZZZ text goes here, any length (max one line)...
</B></i>
<P>
This is a standard APRS message format, except the destination field simply 
contains the word EMAIL padded to 9 spaces and the first word of the message
body is an email address. . This format works well.  A packet transmitted anywhere
in the world in this format on any APRS channel including the satellite channel
 will result in an email to the intended XXXXX@YYYY.ZZZ recepient.  See the
<A HREF="sset.html"><B>Satellite Emergency Email System</B></A>.
<P>
<B>IMPROVED MS PROTOTOL:</B> . Since brevity is paramount in MS packets, the
above format can be improved slightly for better efficiency.  The following
ideas are proposed to improve Email efficiency.  Lets assume a 64 byte
text message.  The original format then takes 25 bytes of overhead and
18 bytes of Eaddress for an efficiency of 60%.
<LI> Change APRSxx to APMAIL and eliminate the nine EMAIL____ bytes. (a 9% improvement to 65%)
<LI> Change APRSxx to APARRL or APJUNO or APASAT to partly eliminate 
     some addressing bytes (25% improvement to 75%)
<P>

This format signals the Email engine to capture these unique 
APARRL, APJUNO, APASAT formatted APRS messages as EMAILS, 
and to also then preload any of the most commmonly used ham radio
Email addresses or aliases.  In this case, the first word of the text message
now only contains the unique part of the email address and not the common
part of it. . Here is an example:
<P>
<B><i>
WB4APR>APARRL::W3XY text:goes here, any length (max one line)...
</B></i>
<P>
Notice that the two colons (:) still bracket the first 9 bytes of the APRS
message format to keep it compatible with the rest of the APRS message system
and all existing client software and radio firmware.  . But now this
special MS Email engine converts the special APARRL
to W3XY@ARRL.NET and the rest of the format is the message
text (ignoring the required colon in the 10th byte position). .
With this improvement, all redundant bytes are eliminated and the only overhead
is 4 bytes or so plus the sender and receivers calls.

<P>
Other specialized keyword APXXXX's could be designated as needed. . That's
pretty efficient. . The total length of this packet at 1200 baud is just 0.63
seconds, which is quite practical for 6m Meteor scatter.
<P>

<B>RETURN MESSAGING:</B> . The above formats are standard APRS message formats
supported by the existing APRS system, and IGate infrastructure. . It full fills 
the original objective to get an emeregency Email out of a disaster area as
long as the transmitting station transmits the packet repeatedly for X minutes
to get a high probabiliy of receipt by any one of the dozens of country wide
APRS receiving IGates...  But this part of the system has no mechanism for
getting a response back into the affected area.  . That response system will
take specialized software.
<P>

To get a message back into the affected area, the IGates must have new firmware
to be able to capture an APRS message from the APRS-Internet system and to then
schedule it for transmission back via MS. . Here is my proposal for that process.
<P>
<LI> New speical MS IGate sofware
<LI> All MS IGates capture the message and schedule it for trasnsmission
<LI> Each IGate transmits using the usual 15 second window for its area
<LI> The four USA quadrants NE, SE, SW, NW transmit at the 00, 15, 30 and 45 seconds of each minute
<LI> IGates are configured to be aware of other IGates in their general quadrant.
<LI> For multiple IGates in the same general area, they too will stagger/share the TX window
<LI> This process is repeated for say 15 minutes to give a 95% probability of delivery.
<P>
Further, if there is no MS traffic pending, these IGates will still periodically
key up with a PILOT packet say once every hour for X minutes as a test packet.  This
IGate will monitor the APRS-IS for its own successes, and use this average value
to determine the amount of time to transmit traffic to get the 97% average 
success rate or so...  This data will also be a way of performance monitoring of
the entire APRS Meteor Scatter system!  
<P>

<B>PERFORMANCE MONITORING:</B> . Imagine the data we can learn using this
self test feature of the APRS MS system.  With this system running 24/7, we
will learn very quickly the value of this system and have dynamic proof of
its probabiliites. . This can be fun!

<P>
WB4APR, Bob
