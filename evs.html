<P>

We've come a long way with EV's in the more than a decade since my 2007 Electric Think Import shown below.
For example, all our cars are now EV's [Volt, Th!nk, Prius-Prime, etc]

<B>My Charge Post:</B> 
On the left was my initial 240v charger installation.  
On the right is how it looks after my wife read me the <B><i> terms and conditions</B></i>
for her garden.  
<BR>So I stained the post and switched out the charge box with a $199 240V black charge cord with the EVSE
electronics built into the charge cord itself.  You can hardly see it, but it IS there!
<P>
<B>How to select an EV:</B> To help explain to people how to consider getting an EV, there are some
very clear must-have answers to their situation before they can proceed.  So I put together the
following flow-chart.  Go for it and ENjoy!

<B>Here are the THIRTY All Battery-Only EV's available in 2020</B>.  Notice that 40% cost less than the average gas model.

<B>Here are the THIRTY TWO PLUGIN HYBRIDS:</B>  37% cost less than the average gas car and all have trip ranges over 350 miles!

<B>EV RANGE:  Fully 50% of all these EVs and PHEV's now have ranges over 350 miles.</B>  
<BR> The chart below 
is sorted by range.  For those who take trips in their EV's these <B>plugins</B> completely elminate
any range anxiety 
<BR>as they have a gas engine for additional miles beyond the typical daily EV range shown.

<B>EV COST:  More than 50% of all these EV's and PHEV's can cost less than the average gas car ($35k)
<BR>
when the various Federal, State and Local incentives are applied.  This list is sorted by Price.

<B>Used EV's are a great bargain:</B> The price for three year old EV's is a great deal.  Checking
<A HREF="http://autotrader.com"><B>AutoTrader.com</B></A> 
<BR>shows 3 year old Volts for under $14k and
similar Leafs for under $9k.  The low price is due to early adopters moving up 
<BR>as more and more
EV's with longer ranges become available and because the first buyer received the $7500 tax credit.

<A HREF="FrankenVolt.html"><B>Emergency Power from your EV:</B> </A> I modified my 2013 used EV 
I bought in 2017 for emergency power
during power outages.  I added solar panels to the roof 
<BR>and wired up a cheap Inverter (120 volts) to
the 12 V battery to provide up to a kW of power for all the lights in the house and critical loads like the
refrigerator, PC, TV, etc.
<BR>By interfacing only with the 12 Volt battery, it eliminates any problems with the unique high voltage 
system and any warranty issues.
