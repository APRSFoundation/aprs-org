<B>APRStt Satellite to be launched!</B> The <A HREF="psat2.html"><B>PSAT2</b></A> satellite is scheduled for 
launch this june (2019) and will be the first APRStt satellite.  It will allow users with nothing more than
a DTMF handheld to report their position anyhwere on earth via Touchtone.  The satellite responds by voice
and by converting the data to an APRS packet downlink too.
<P>

<B>APRStt Frequency Announcements:</B> New as of Nov 2015 is a modification of the 
APRStt flying on the satellite  to use it terrestrially as well.  This arrangement is called the APRStt Frequency Announcer.  Here is what it does if set up
on a local simplex frequency such as 146.58 so that anyone with any radio with a TT keypad can use:
<LI> Any DTMF-only user permanently stores his DTMF Callsign (eg: WB4APR, and 2 digit repeater code eg: 94 in a DTMF memory
<LI> At anytime he can send this memory on 146.58 from memory with one button push with these results:
<LI> 1) The APRStt Frequency Announcer speaks <B><i>"WB4APR listening 146.94"</i></B>
<LI> 2) The APRStt engine also sends out an APRS packet on APRS saying: . 
        <B><i>WB4APR>APRStt:!DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.mmWA146.940MHz listening APRStt</B></i>
<LI> 3) The packet is digipeated locally and worldwide via the APRS-IS system.
<LI> 4) The DTMF users call shows on the local and global APRS maps in the local "TT-corral" table area on the map (as descibed further down this page)

<LI> 5) Anyone with a Kenwood or Yaesu APRS radio that sees that packet can press their TUNE or QSY button and instantly have their radio tune to the DTMF users frequency
<LI> 6) Anyone monitoring the 146.58 "Frequency Announcing" channel will hear who is on the air, what freq and when.
<LI> 7) If the users channel is an Echolink or other networked channel, then anyone in the world that saw him on the APRS-IS can give him a call!

<P>
With APRStt, not just the 5% of hams who have APRS radios can communicate, but now anyone with
any radio and a DTMF keypad can join the global APRS and VOIP radio system.  He can store any
of his favorite 2 digit repeater ID's in his DTMF memories for instant access.
<P>

<B>Change in DTMF Callsign Format:</B> 
As of Spring 2015, (and now in draft as 
<A HREF="aprstt/APRStt-ver301.doc"><B>APRStt3.01 spec</B></A>, due to the design for the APRStt satellite
PSAT2 we have a better callsign format that only takes 10 keys instead of 12. This is much more of
an improvement than just 20%, since it allows now a full callsign AND four digit data field all in
a single DTMF burst from DTMF memory. Until this filters
down through all the historical APRStt documents, you can find this new format on the
<A HREF="psat2.html"><B> PSAT2</B></A> web page.  Basically it is just the 6 keys of the
callsign followed by a 4 digit code that tells the position of each of those 6 letters on the
DTMF keys.  To calculate the number see the PSAT2 link or use the online 
calculator.  Similarly, a 3 letter suffix can be encoded in just 5 keys which makes a perfect
match to the 5 digit ANI built into some radios.  We are trying to build a table of DTMF
<A HREF="aprstt/APRStt30radios-b.txt"><B>radio capabilities</B></A>.  Please send in info on your type radio.

<P>

<B>CHANGE IN DTMF Position Format:</B> As of August 2013, we have reversed the DTMF format sequence from XX...YY... to YY...XX...
to keep APRStt DTMF consistent wtih all the rest of APRS/GPS since we always speak in the
sequence of "LAT/LONG" and so we should indicate YY.. before XX...  It may take a while for all this
to filter down through all the old docs.  But this is now the standard.  No maps have to change, only
the docs on the DTMF formats.

<P>
<B>APRStt is an engine at an event that listens for DTMF data entered by anyone using
any HT with a keypad and converts it over to the APRS data channel for distribution
to all APRS systems and viewers as shown in the sketch above.</B>

<P>
<B>Projects in Work:</B> APRStt is just part of the overall Ham Radio Initiative for
<A HREF="universal-contact.html"><B> Universal Contact by-callsign</B></A>.  It is 
appropriate for ANY ham radio system that receives input from users via DTMF such
as repeaters and VOIP applications.  APRStt specific aps are being developed
by Byonics as an add-on board to his TT4 (shown below) and by KA2UPW called APRSspeak,
and John Langner WB2OSZ is working on a speaking version as well. 
In 2011,  WB6NIL, Jim Dixon, author of the 
<A HREF="https://allstarlink.org/about.html"><B> AllStar VOIP Repeater system</B></A>
 was experimenting with accepting APRStt userd DTMF Callsigns on his inputs.  This allows his
users to indicate their <i><b> presence</i></B> to the global APRS community.  And hopefully,
Echolink is also considering it.
<P>

<B>APRStt4:</B> This is the Tiny Track TT4 with the add-on DTMF daughter board making a complete stand
alone special event APRStt engine.  We have used this for two marathons so far and it works great.
Juse one of these at the event can translate all DTMF user reports over to the APRS channel so that
all can see everything on APRS.
<P>
 <IMG SRC="aprstt/APRStt4dX.jpg">
<P>

<B>APRS DTMF Marathon:</B> The map above right is how we used APRStt at a local Marathon to allow anyone with
any HT to report their location into the APRS tactical picture.  First, a grid was added to
 the Marathon Map (shown here) allowing position reporting using only 2 digits of X and Y to report anywhere
on the map using the DTMF format of B2YYXX*....  
Further the exact locations of each mile mark were entered into a table and then a simpler
B9MM* format could be used to report position by milemark.  Either DTMF format was OK.
<P>


<B>Byonics TT-4 add-on DTMF adapter:</B> Shown above is the Byonics DTMF adapter added to a 
TinyTrack4 which does all of the conversion from DTMF and generates a resulting APRS formatted
packet for transmission by any FM radio.  
The Dayton 2013 version works fine for the B1YX* and the B2YYXX* position formats, but until Byonics implements
the Mile Mark B9mm* format translation procedure, I added a small BS2 chip processor 
<A HREF = "aprstt/DTMF-board0234x.jpg"><B> (dead bug style) </B></A>
and used it to parse
the packet from the TT4, do the mile-mark conversion and then output the resulting string 
in digital
format to the TNC in a D700 radio.  The DTMF radio also generates a CW ack to the DTMF user
on the 146.58 input to let him know his DTMF codes were received correctly.
For my CPU version, only one radio was needed (the D700) to
receive the DTMF reports on 146.58 MHz and then do the conversions and then transmit the
packet into APRS  using the other side of the radio.  

For normal APRStt4 using the Byonics TT4 and DTMF card, no other TNC is needed, just two analog radios.
You cannot use a single dual band radio for this function since the D700 dual band radios 
cannot be both operated at the same time from the Speaker/Mic or back panel
audio connections simultaneously.  You can use one dual band but wihtout separate PTT, you have to give up the
CW ACK transmitted back on the DTMF channel.  For the Marathon with milemarks and one radio, see the
<A HREF="aprstt/Box0241x.jpg"><B> photo of the box</B></A> placed in the woods on a hill
to cover the event.
<P>


<B>Simplest APRStt - CALLSIGN only:</B> In its simplest form, APRStt lets anyone with a DTMF
memory in his HT or mobile check-in to the global APRS system without needing a special
APRS radio.  <i>For example, the callsign <B>WB4APR</B> in DTMF is spelled as 
<B>9A2B42A7A7C</B></i>. That one callsign-burst sent from a DTMF memory  is
 received by the APRStt receiver and converted into the APRS
system with all of the following important information:
<P>
<LI> His CALL, DATE and TIME are captured
<LI> His POSITION is plotted with a special APRStt icon within the vicinity list of that receiver location
<LI> His FREQUENCY (and tone/shift) may be included so he can be contacted
<LI> His EchoLink/ILRP number (or reverse patch number) may be included so he can be called 
<LI> Some text information may be added relative to what is going on in that area

<P>
<B><i> Callsign Presence</B></i> (someone is on the air), is most of what APRS is used for
anyway, and with DTMF, it can be done from any HT
or mobile radio.  This is part of the overall move towards Universal Text and Voice
connectivity-by-callsign Initiative.  The idea is that anyone on any system, 
using any device can contact
any other ham anywhere, on any system, using any device by callsign alone.  The APRS-IS
provides the <B><i> presence</i></B> by callsign as to who is on the air, where, on what
system, and how he can be contacted.  APRS already does the 
<A hREF="aprs-messaging.html"><B>Universal Text</B></A> portion of this project and
the <A HREF="avrs.html"><B> Automatic Voice Relay System (AVRS)</B></A> for voice.

Notice that no manual data entry is required from the user other than
initiating his DTMF callsign memory.  Use K3PO's 
<A HREF="http://www.retroscape.com/aprstt/"><B>Callsign Translator</B></A>
to calculate your DTMF callsign. 

<P>
<B>Programming your DTMF Memory:</B> Here is how to program your DTMF callsign into
some specific radios:
<LI> <A HREF="aprstt/DTMF-TH-D7.html"><B>Kenwood TH-D7</B></A>
<LI> <A HREF="aprstt/DTMF-HTX-202.html"><B>Radio Shack HTX-202</B></A>
<LI> <A HREF="aprstt/DTMF-AlincoDJG7.html"><B>Alinco DJG7</B></A>
<LI> <A HREF="FT51-TH78.html"><B>FT51 and TH78 DTMF signalling</B></A>
<LI> <A HREF="aprstt/DTMF-China.html"><B>Wouxun and Baofeng</B></A> radios have ANI but no DTMF memories 


<P>

<B>APRStt at Dayton 2010:</B>  Doug Quagliana KA2UPW demonstrated APRStt at Dayton 2010 with his
program called APRS-Speak.  Hams could keep track of their buddies and appear on all APRS displays
 by sending their 2 digit position from the
handheld map shown below using the B1YX* format followed by their callsign from DTMF memory.
They could also transmit their monitoring FREQUENCY using
the format <B><i>CFFFFFF*</i></B> which is the frequency in KHz. 
  
This would place them anywhere at the Hamvention to the nearest 120 feet or so.  
<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/DaytonMapHandout1.GIF">
<BR><A HREF="aprstt/DaytonMapHandout.GIF"><B>Print two map copies per page</B></A> (or reduce to 75% on copier and get 4 per sheet)
<P>
<B>TWO-DIGIT Coordinates at Dayton:</B>  You can also position yourself anywhere within 60 miles in the dayton
area with the 2-digit DTMF position format <B>B2YYXX*</B> format.  In this case the XX and YY are the minutes
of LAT lONG as in 34YY North and 84XX West.  You can also locate yourself using the simple sketch map
in the Dayton Hamvention Boolket as shown <A HREF="dayton/Dayton-area-2keyX.gif"><B> here</B></A>.  Notice the 
AA and YY grid on the edges.  YY is vertical Latitude and XX is horizontal Longitude.

<P>
<B>HISTORY:</B> We first demonstrated the APRStt concept back in 2001 at Dayton using hardware DTMF decoders
and a parallel port voice synthesizer, and a French team made a demo windows version around 2006
and then Rick Ruhl <B>W4PC</B> of CSS implemented
a version for 2009 using soundcards that he called
<A HREF="http://www.cssincorp.com"><B>Radio Spotter</B></A>.
It would run on a PC with nothing but a dual band radio (or pair of radios) to
 establishe a local APRStt zone 
where any nearby HT that ID's itself by DTMF memory will be converted to APRS at that location.
or they can enter their position data too.  
In 2010 KA2UPW demonstrated the above implementation and Byonics began a hardware 
version by adding a DTMF decoder chip to a TinyTrack-4 as a stand-alone APRStt engine.. 
This hardware version is showning great promise in testing in 2013 for an upcoming Marathon!
<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/Dayton-user-map.GIF">
<P>
This map above shows the view of the Hamvention area on Sunday 2009.  This is from
FINDU.COM but it uses the original APRSdos map so you can see the booths inside the building.
You can see the APRStt users along the left edge that have transmitted their callsigns but not
yet their detail position.  APRStt puts these calls in an unused area of the local map
so they can at least be seen in the area.  Those that enter the additional <B>B1yx*</B>
detail position from the grid map can be seen elsewhere on the map.  I see two.  The actual
position of the APRStt engine  runnning <B> Radio Spotter</B> is in the center underneath
the W4PC symbol.  Zooming in once more reveals it.  APRStt assigns a -12 SSID to all 
APRStt users when they are gated from DTMF to APRS.  This view does not even include 
the surrounding parking lots, and hotels.  It was reported that there were over
300 APRS stations in Dayton as of Saturday morning and counting.
<P>

<B>APRStt BACKGROUND:</B>
<P>

<B>APRStt, (APRS Touch-Tone</B><font size=-2>(tm)</font>) is an APRS protocol for
 a two-way DTMF-to-APRS gateway to permit the other 95% of ham radio operators 
with voice-only radios to exchange information and data with the APRS system and
users.
Not only can they "check-in" or send any APRS data
from their DTMF keypad, but they can also monitor the APRStt voice output channel
for all the voice responses which speak APRS information back to these voice users.
They can also query any information and receive voice response.  This is just another part
of the Global/Local <A HREF="aprs-messaging.html"><B>Ham Radio Text Messaging/Contact Initiative</B></A>. .
<P>
APRStt allows all ham radio operators to participate in the APRS information system, not just
those with the specialized APRS radios (D7, D700, D710, VX8R, HAMHUD, etc) or those
with TNC's and mobile laptops.  With APRStt, anyone can enter information, Let everyone know
their operting frequency or show up
on the local map and hear
what is going on.  To help us understand the baseline of existing DTMF capability
See the <A HREF="aprstt/radios.txt"><B> DTMF radio capabilities list</B></A>.  
<P>

<B>THINKING OUTSIDE THE APRS <I>TRACKING</I> BOX:</B>
<P>
Everyone has heard me say over and over that APRS is not a tracking system, but is a common
local/global information exchange and distribution system for tactical and real time data of
immediate communincations support value to users.  To appreciate the potential of APRStt, 
you have got to forget 
about APRS as a tracking system, and think about what kinds of simple digital data can
be exchanged in support of an event or local activity.  Here are several DATA items 
that can easily be sent by DTMF::
<P>
<LI> The user's Voice Monitoring Frequency
<LI> The user's SAR UTM Grid coordinates
<LI> Event Times, Scores, Unit ID's, item counts, speeds, distances, etc
<LI> Position (yes, and even position)

<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/aprstt-105.GIF"> 
<P>

<B>APRStt ON THE MAP:</B> On receipt of nothing but an APRStt user's DTMF callsign,
the station will immediately appear in the APRS system on the map in LIST format
near the location of the APRStt gate.  On the APRS map above, not only do you see all of the 
usual APRS operators (about a 32 mile wide map between Washington DC on the left,
and Annapolis to the right), but
in the lower right, you also see the 147.105 "local travelers repeater" along with
the DTMF users on that repeater.  All DTMF users (with the -12 SSID)
show on the map as a LIST
in the vicinity of the APRStt gateway or repeater where they were last heard.
<P>

Additional Position reporting formats are available to give approximate and even precise
positions.  Positions can be reported by Mile mark, or Station number or checkpoint at
events.  Any numbering system can be incorporated.  At Dayton, position reporting by
simply entering the BOOTH or Flea Market number are possible.  See
<P>

<B>VOICED INFORMATION:</B>  Even without using DTMF or inputing any data, anyone can 
tune into the APRStt voice channel
and hear unsolicited information of local significance.  Positions are reported
as a direction and range from a reference point (usually the APRStt engine).  For
example <I>"WB4APR is 4.5 miles northeast"</i>.  Of course APRStt users can change
the reference point by DTMF command such as <I>"from the repeater"</i> or <i>"from downtown"</i> 
or <i>"from FINISH",</i> etc.
For example, here are some of the unsolicited reports that were implemented in APRStt1.0
back in 2001:
<P>
<LI> APRStt would speak the frequency of any station that changed the freq in his packet
<LI> APRStt would speak the call and location of any new callsign that was heard
<LI> APRStt would speak the local FREQUENCY object for travlers as they came into town
<LI> APRStt would speak the movements of many special stations.
<UL> A) Any TH-D7 using the  TRIANGLE ICON
<BR> B) Any D700 or any other APRS mobile using the "/n" ICON
<BR> C) Any one station commanded by the APRStt operator (or DTMF user)
</UL>
<LI> APRStt would speak the AZ and EL and Frequency of any satellite in view
<LI> APRStt would speak the TRAFFIC Speed past any TRAFFIC choke point that is
     listed in the TRAFFIC.POS file.  This was for daily commuters.
     See the original <A HREF="traffic/traffic.txt"><B>TRAFFIC.TXT</B></A> file.

<P>

<B>APRStt TYPICAL APPLICATIONS:</B>
There are several primary uses of this APRStt application and in many cases, 
mopst of the needed data can be preloaded in to DTMF memories in advance
such as the callsign or frequently used positions or repeater frequency.
  So with just as little as one or two DTMF memory replays, the DTMF user
can send his data to APRS and be seen around the world in the vicinity of that 
APRStt in real time.  Here are some examples.
<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>APRStt Simplex frequency:</B> Allows anyone with a pre-loaded DTMF callsign to "check-in"
to the global APRS system with one DTMF memory button and appear in the vicinity
of that APRStt gateway.  With a second DTMF memory, he can
transmit what repeater frequency he is monitoring.  On receipt, APRStt then adds
<i>location and other local information such as the EchoLink-IRLP number 
/local application status</i> to the data before sending it
over to the APRS channel.  With all this information, the station appears in APRS like
any other station and can be contacted from anywhere locally or around the world.
<P>
<LI><B>Special Event:</B> This APRStt gateway usually
would run on a laptop plugged into a radio in the field receiving the DTMF data and converting
it to APRS messages or positions for use of DTMF HT's 
for reporting data, scores, numbers, or positions or simple data at special events. 
See the <A HREF="aprsevent.html"><B>APRS event</B></A>  application where D7 HT's are used
for sending in troop scores during a scouting event.  Yet ANY HT with a keypad can do
the same data reporting if there is an APRStt gateway on site.
<P>
<LI><B>Repeater Applications:</B> Just like for the simplex method.  Is used for mobiles to 
check-in to the global APRS system and have APRS know their present frequency.  A common
SIMPLEX channel is still used for the DTMF input (to avoid potential problems if
DTMF was sent on the repeater input).  But the repeater has an associated APRStt gateway
ro provide voice response on the repeater output back to the user.
<P>

<LI><B>Search-and-Rescue:</B> good SAR teams always have detail maps of their assigned
areas and are very well trained in the map grid system.  THey can report their position
in UTM grid using APRStt.  The more expensive and less readily available GPS trackers
can be given to the less experienced SAR teams who have trouble reading a map.

<P>
<LI><B>EchoLink or IRLP:</B> Since these VOIP systems already have the DTMF decoding
and voice synthesizer that is used by APRStt, these nodes are ideal for integrating
into APRStt.  A check-in to global APRS via one of these nodes is only a DTMF memory button away.
<A HREF="aprstt/aprstt-user.txt"><B>(see user guide)</B></A>. 

<P>
<LI><B>APRStt National Travelers Channel:</B>  If by som emiracle, a single simplex
channel could be defined across the country like we have for APRS, then travelers with
only a DTMF radio could report there approximate location by only their callsign
according to what was the most recent APRStt system that heard him.
<P>

</UL>
<i>For example, the callsign <B>WB4APR</B> in DTMF is spelled as <B>9A2B42A7A7C</B></i>. 
That one callsign-burst when received by the APRStt receiver and forwarded into the APRS
system yields all of the following important information:
<P>
<LI> His CALL, DATE and TIME are captured
<LI> His POSITION is plotted with a special APRStt icon within a vicinity list of that receiver
<LI> His FREQUENCY (and tone/shift) is included so he can be contacted
<LI> His EchoLink/ILRP number (or reverse patch number) are included so he can be called 
<LI> He can include a few bytes of text message if he wants
<P>

<BR>
<B>RECEIVING APRS on TH-78 and FT-51R RADIOS:</B> Both the Kenwood TH-78 and Yaesu FT-51R radios
back in the 1990's had a message TX/RX capablity using DTMF.  The APRStt engine can be 
configured to transmit
local APRS information similar to the above onto the front panel of these radios too.  Please see
the <A HREF="FT51-TH78.html"><B>HT51/78 project</B></A>
<P>

<img src="aprstt/aprstt-ht.GIF" align=right>

<B>APRStt BACKGROUND:</B>  APRStt was initially introduced at the RAC convention in 2001
and subsequently at Dayton in 2001.  By the next year, Voice response had been added.  This
system demonstrated the ability to let not just the 5% of ham radio operators 
with APRS, but now 100%
of all mobiles and HT's or traveling operators out of their local area
to be identified from anywhere in the world when they are operational.  Since Kenwood
introduced global APRS text-messaging and email into their APRS HT in 1998,  APRStt 
was developed to include the other 95% of ham radio operators by acting as a gateway 
between their existing DTMF HT's and the rest of the APRS community.

<P>
<B>KATRINA FREQUENCY INCENTIVE:</B>  After Katrina, APRS responded to the ARRL initiative to
make sure that every ham radio operator in a disaster area can be located by his
frequency.  This initiative was called the <B>Automatic Frequency Reporting System</B>
<A HREF="afrs.html"><B>AFRS</B></A>.  At that time, the Voice FREQUENCY field
was added into the APRS system so that we could find the voice contact frequency
for all APRS operators.  In addition, not only
could APRS users report their operating frequency, but also the wide area Voice
repeaters used by travelers could beacon their frequency onto the front panel of
all APRS radios.  
<A HREF="localinfo.html"><B>See the LOCALINFO Initiative</B></A>.
In response to that initiative, Kenwood developed the D710 mobile radio that
not only automatically includes the operators present voice operating frequency 
in every position report, but also can tune to any other APRS operators frequency
or travelers repeater with just the push of the TUNE button.
<P>

The combination of the  
<A HREF="aprs.html"><B>original APRS</B></A>, the addition of Frequency in
<A HREF="afrs.html"><B>AFRS</B></A>, the use of 
<A HREF="localinfo.html"><B>Repeater Frequency Objects</B></A>, and
<A HREF="aprstt.html"><B>APRStt</B></A>, gives a univeral, global, system
for identification and localization of all radio amateurs by only their
callsign.  Any station in the world can be located (or contacted live)
through any of the
live RF APRS application programs or on the web by any of the WEB based
APRS systesm such as FINDU.COM as shown below:
<P>

<B>APRStt VOICE RESPONSE:</B> The feedback from APRStt to DTMF users is all by
synthesized voice.  The APRStt acknowledges a properly decoded DTMF checkin with 
"Welcome CCCC".   APRS messages to a DTMF user are spoken.  APRS positions when
spoken over APRStt are always spoken as a DIRECTION and DISTANCE from a local
REFERENCE.  By defualt, the local reference is the location of the APRStt
engine itself, but this reference can be changed by the DTMF user to any other
APRS location in the system. DIRECTION is spoken as the 16 cardinal points of
the compass as in North, NorthNortheast, Northeast, EastNorthEast, East, etc.
This verbal positioning lets <I> everyone </i> in the club or at an event 
participate in the exchange of APRS data, not just those with the APRS radios.
Even the old codger that shows up with his venerable 20 year old HT can participate!
<P>

<B>APRStt SIMPLEX:</B> It is suggested that an APRStt gateway should monitor
the national simplex frequency of 146.58 in the USA for anyone that
wants to check in by DTMF.  If that channel is already "claimed" by some other
application, then the other possible frequencies that are compatible with 
both the National ARRL and the 20 KHz plans are 146.46, 156.58, 147.42, 147.48,
147.54.  But it would be nice to use a common frequency where possible (146.58)
for travelers.
<P>

<B>Other APRStt:</B> Any other system that has DTMF users can also be
used as an APRStt input device.  For example some repeater controllers, 
EchoLink, and IRLP nodes, and any other ham radio applications that receive DTMF 
to accept the DTMF callsign burst and generate the APRS data for 
transmission over to the APRS network.</B>  But even if we dont get controller manufacturers
to add this to their products, we can probably add a DTMF chip to any of the
small APRS PIC devices such as the 
 <A HREF="http://www.byonics.com/microtrak/"><B>Micro-Track</B></A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.argentdata.com/products/tracker2.html"><B>Opentrackers</B></A> 
and design them to be DTMF ==> APRS gateways.  <B>See BYONICS.COM booth this year at Dayton!</B>
They can be either stand-alone
devices on any frequency or easily added onto older non-programmable repeater controllers:
<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/aprstt-microtrak.JPG">
<P>
The DTMF chip plus a Microtrack could simply connect to the repeater RX audio 
and to an easy whip antenna as shown above.  Done.
<P>
Or for special events, or simplex nets, or any place you want to make it easy 
for non-APRS voice users to be visible to APRS, a simple Opentracker+ with a 
DTMF chip could go on a <B>dongle</B> and be attached to any HT making that
HT be an APRStt gateway for everyone else at that event as shown below.  
<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/aprstt-OT.JPG">
<P>
Or for marathons or any large mass movement of ham radio operators, imagine if you
placed one of these automomous APRStt Gateways at every checkpoint along the 
Marathon route.  As Hams moved about the event, if ever they changed locations from one
area to another, all they had to do was send their DTMF callsign memory, then the
APRS event map would know approximately where they were and/or what frequency 
they were monitoring..  The APRS symbol for a DTMF user is a gray DTMF keypad.
But for future expansion, it can have up to 36 overlay characters for special
applications.
The APRS symbol for an APRStt gateway is a green square with "TT" in the middle of it.
<P>

<IMG SRC="aprstt/aprstt-marks.JPG">
<P>

<B>Field Data Entry:</B> Since these same DTMF radio users can also enter small 
text messages, they can also be used for entering data from checkpoints or other
field applications.  See how to use an APRS HT for 
<A HREF="aprsevent.html"><B>field-data entry</B></A>

<P>
Or lets say for an event which has maybe 6 operating frequencies, repeaters, simplex channels
or whatever.  Users just send their monitoring frequency on the APRStt input channel, and
they appear on the map as a LIST by that frequency as shown below:
<P>

<IMG SRC="aprstt/aprstt-event.JPG">
<P>
In the above view, the "location" of each APRStt receiver is given a completely arbitrary
position so that it shows up conveniently in an out of way place on the APRS event map.
Clustered around it are the DTMF callsigns that have checked in (by DTMF)
 on that particular frequency.

<P>

<IMG SRC="aprstt/APRStt-repeater.GIF" align=right>
<B> APRStt will revolutionize ham radio</B> because it lets 100% of ham radio users "check-in"
to the global APRS system to facilitate end-to-end contact between operators.  APRS users 
have been doing this since 1995 or so, but now the other 95% of ham radio operators can
participate.  The simplest form of APRStt is
each user putting his DTMF callsign into a DTMF memory in his radio.  If there is an APRStt
engine monitoring his favorite repeater, 
then all he has to do to appear on APRS is
to send his DTMF memory!  He will appear on the global APRS system as an object within
ambiguity range of that voice repeater and showing that frequency!
See <A HREF="localinfo.html"><B> how important voice frequency is to APRS</B></A>.
The image to the right is the roll-your-own way to do it if it is not implemented in the
controller or the VOIP software.
<P>

<B>APRStt responds!</B> On hearing the DTMF callsign and sending out the position 
and frequency packet on the APRS channel, the more advanced APRStt implementations
will respond by voice with 
<B><i>"Welcome W3XYZ!"</B></i> as confirmation.  This is really no different than
what mobiles do now "WB4APR LIstening", except that using the DTMF method is
machine readable and allows this <i>presence</i> to the global ham radio community
via APRS instead of falling on deaf ears.
<P>

<B>APRStt two-way:</B> Now then, these same more sophisticated 
APRStt systems can also watch the APRS system for any messages addressed to you.
Hearing any, they will SPEAK them back to you on the voice channel!
The specialized full two-way <B>APRStt Engine</B> can be as simple as a laptop 
at any repeater site or located in the valley at a home station as shown below.  

<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/tt-gate.jpg" align=right>
<P>
<B>APRStt will revolutionize how you do special events!</B>  Everyone with any HT at any 
event will be able to keep the overall <A HREF="aprs.html"> <B> APRS </B></A> map and communications picture updated with
their position, status and other needed data!  Now the Kenwood APRS HT's and Mobiles will
have someone to talk with!  As long as there is
an APRStt gateway nearby, DTMF users can send POSITS, MESSAGES, EMAIL and Queries with 
their TTone pads and hear VOICE responses (on the APRStt channel).  
<B> APRStt</B> was demonstrated during
Dayton in May and the RAC convention in Vernon B.C. in July 2002. 

<P>
For field events, the <B>APRStt Engine</B> can be as simple as a laptop and two HT's  
supporting a special event or field activity as shown to the right.  
Once this suite is activated at an event, 
it lets EVERYONE listen to APRS information and input APRS information
using any two way radio (usually on a dedicated simplex channel). 
<P>

<B>APRStt</B> is the gateway for DTMF voice users to report themselves to the
global APRS community of users.
It enables all non-APRS HT's and Mobile radios to be located and this information is
fundamental to facilitating ham radio communications.  See some examples:

<P>
<LI> Use DTMF to "check in" as noted above
<LI> A check-in indicates the date and time of your immediate availablity
<LI> A check-in puts you on the local/ national or global map
<LI> A check-in also identifies your voice frequency to everyone
<LI> Voice response informs the APRStt user of anything he needs to know
<LI> APRStt can speak incoming messages to APRStt users
<LI> APRStt allows DTMF origination of messages, emails or anything else in APRS
<LI> APRStt can speak the position ("LEAD is 3.5 miles NW of FINISH") of special trackers
<LI> APRStt can speak the bearing and range to any object or even satellites that come into view...
<LI> Users can QUERY APRStt with DTMF about ANYTHING on the air in APRS...
<LI> APRS/APRStt can even tie into the global Echooink system for global voice comms knowing only a callsign!
<A HREF="avrs.html"><B> See all about AVRS</B></A>
<P>

<B>Not just DTMF and Voice:</B> Some radios already have paging, and DTMF texting
send and receive.  These radios can take advantage of APRStt by integrating them 
into the APRS system.

<LI> DTMF text receipt and display is possible on some HT's (TH-28/48/78, FT-11/41/51, IC-231) [LATER]
<LI> APRStt could also do Paging to modified pagers on the HAM bands. [LATER]

<P>
<B>APRStt IS LOCAL:</B>  Whether implemented on a repeater, a VOIP node or a simplex
frequency, APRStt is simply local, yet transparently integrated with the local 
and global APRS system.  More sophisticated users can take advantage of some of the
clever system of abbreviations and short cuts so that positions, messages and many other
things can be entered with only a few key strokes.  As in the examples above, just
sending a callsign is enough to  put put you on the global map with a position
in the vicinity of the local APRStt repeater or node.
<P>

<B>The remainder of this page is the full original APRStt details that would probably 
only be used for
special applicaitons needing more than the basic CALLSIGN identification noted
above.   But it does show the potential of using our HT keypads like modern teen
agers do with their text-messaging from their cell phones!</B>
<HR SIZE=5 WIDTH="100%">
<P>

For special applications needing better position reporting, a fully precise
position can be entered with only 6 digits, because the APRStt signal is only on
local RF simplex range of the APRStt engine.  This establishes the LAT/LONG significant
digits and only the lower 6 precise YYYXXX digits are needed to nail down your
exact position.  For example, YYYXXX is equivalent to DDMy.yyN/DDDMx.xxW because the
DDM and DDDM are already known in that area.  
For fixed events that have known checkpoints or locations, or mile marks, then just
a 3 digit position is possible!  The DTMF string ABB becomes the BBth position in the A table.
For a marathon,
simply "013" could put you on the map at mile mark 13. etc.  So think outside the box.
this is not just using DTMF to enter a LAT/LONG, not at all.  This is a system designed
from the ground up to serve a specific purpose at the local event or area and to make
it SIMPLE for the end user with only DTMF to enter meaningful data.
<P>


<B>TT-KEYPAD:</B>  We can make this as all inclusive as we want.  In addition to the simple
examples above we can do ANYTHING in APRS with DTMF with enough patience.  
Don't let the numbers in the below example fool you.  You dont have
to remember these.  Just type the letters on the DTMF like any text-messaging teenager.
For example type "APR" on
your DTMF pad and the resulting DTMF tones are 27A777 which is matched to WB4APR in the APRStt
callsign table.  If there is a conflict then fully spell it using normal text messaging
techniques and it is WBB04AP-RRR which is 9220427A777 and is a precise match..
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>
<B>EXAMPLE 1.  DTMF to Packet Conversions:</B>
<P> A922444427A77*82#.  becomes:<I>WB4APR>APDT,WIDE:/030415z385 .  N/0762 .  Wv</I> <== A van in the vicinity
<BR> B4927*1531#...............becomes:<I>WB4APR>APDT,WIDE:/030425z3949.27N/08415.31W </I> <== Exact position in the APRS booth!
<BR> C3*20480602803333#  becomes:<I>WB4APR>APDT,WIDE::EMAIL    :bruninga@maile.earthlink.net Get me at 3.</I>
<BR> C92111278*2775*52#  becomes:
<I>WB4APR>APDT::WA1APT   :Really enjoyed being with you.  Looking forward to getting together again.</I>
<P>
In the first case, the CALL, ICON and any comments are included and the position is posted
as a 10 mile ambiguous position in the vicinity of the APRStt system.  Subsequent TTone
entries can refine the position without having to re-enter the call.  In the second
exmaple, the four digit LAT/LONG places me at an exact location inside the Dayton Arena.
The third example is an Email sent to address book #2 (for that user).  In the
forth case C92111278* indicates a message to WA1APT.  The "2775*52"
decodes to ARRL#52 which explodes to the text shown. <A HREF="aprstt/aprsttARRL.txt">(ARRL RadioGram)...</A>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>EXAMPLE 2.  VOICE responses to simple DTMF Queries:</B>
<BR> QND..............................QUERY for the nearest DIGI to me: <I>"AA3JY is NORTHWEST 3.5 MILES"</I>
<BR> QNM.............................Query for the nearest MOBILE to me: <I>"K3FOR is SOUTHEAST 15 MILES"</I>
<BR> QRD*0924277#...........Query for WB4APR relative to downtown: <I>"WB4APR is NORTHWEST 9.3 MILES FROM DOWNTOWN"</I>
<P>
<B> EXAMPLE 3. Automatic Voice tracking of SPECIAL objects. </B>  In this case, the main
tracker or station or object at an event can be designated as special and then APRStt
is placed in SPECIAL TRACKER Mode.  It will VOICE report the location of the SPECIAL
packets whenever they come in.  Positions are reported as direction and distance to
known reference points.
<P>
<B> EXAMPLE 4.  APRSTT can voice announce satelites in view! </B>  Since APRSdata is
already putting out an APRS object on 144.39 whenever an active AMSAT is in view, by 
using the command ACTIVATE AMSATS (AA), APRStt can be told to VOICE report these
satellites whenever any are in view...
<P>

<B>NEW:</B> To help very small CUBESAT satellites support an APRS mission, we have added
a simple SPACE subset to the APRStt specification to make it easy for HT's to send APRS
data via these small satellites using only DTMF tones!
See <A HREF="aprstt/aprstt-s.txt"><B> SPACE-APRStt </B></A>.

<B>Thus, ANY radio can send APRS data just like the Kenwoods! (with NOTHING attached)
See the <A HREF="aprstt/aprstt-user.txt"><B>APRStt User Guide</B></A> for how to spell
things on a DTMF keypad.
<P>
To date, the only radio-only APRS signalling method has been the Kenwood D7 and D700 radios
 with their internal TNC's.  But even so,
 the user interface is still only the HT's ubiquitous TTone keypad.  
APRStt simply moves the TT-to-APRS conversion from a TNC in the HT, to a PC on the hill
so that ANY existing radio can be used instead of requiring a Processor and TNC
to be built into every radio!  Further, the DTMF users can receive feedback data via the 
text-to-speech (or CW) process built into APRStt. 
<P>
<B>HISTORICAL STUFF From original 2001 Introduction of APRStt:</B>  APRStt was originally
written for a DOS PC with a DTMF decoder chip and resistor D/A string on the LPT parallel port
of a PC.  This was intended to inspire someone with Windows skills to write an all-software
version using a sound card and no unique hardware. 

Click here for the <A HREF="aprstt/aprstt.txt"> original (2004) APRStt SPEC.</A> 
and all of my detail implementation notes.</B>
or here for <A HREF="aprstt/aprsttformats.txt"><B>an original (2004) simplified version</B></A>.
<P> 
You can even download the original APRSdos version (obsolete).
 <A HREF="ftp://tapr.org/aprssig/dosstuff/APRSdos/aprstt01.zip">
DOWNLOAD </A> APRStt01.zip. </B> 
(Ignore any previous copies such as 04) With this progarm you could begin playing with APRStt
on your own and see how it works.  Even if you dont build the DTMF 
hardware interface, this program will let you enter DTMF equivalents on your
keyboard to see how the conversions work over on the APRS side.  I recommend that you
run it on a Laptop with a D7 on low power and then watch what your Base-Station APRS
system does with the packets.
<P>
<B>DTMF INTERFACE:</B> The original APRStt.exe worked with a simple
<A HREF="aprstt/8880chip.txt"> $5 DTMF decoder chip on the LPT1 Printer port </A>
and runs on any old DOS PC (eventually to be located at your voice repeater site 
(or other "receive" site (maybe 147.555?))).  It
performs the TTone to APRS conversion for all DTMF users in the area and sends the
packets via its own TNC to the APRS system.
<P>
<B>VOICE INTERFACE:</B> The original APRStt.exe does NOT need a sound card.  It speaks through 
8 resistors on the LPT1 port so ANY old PC or laptop can be used...  You can even
record your own voice for the responses..
<P>
<B>HT DTMF MEMORIES:</B> The APRStt format definitions combined with
the TTone memories built-in to most radios allows for nominal APRS
operations with only a few key strokes.  In fact, the number of key
strokes can actually be less than for entering the same message via the
keyboard on a Kenwood APRS radio!  This is because APRStt uses a heuristic
approach to abbreviate most commands...
<P>
The following APRSdos map of Dayton shows me in the vicinity of the AMSAT
Dinner using only the DTMF entry of <B> B47*09.</B>  Notice my call within
a 1 mile ambiguity circle down where the Amber Rose restaurant is located
(and near those APRS mobiles parked in its parking lot!).
<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/TT-amsat.jpg">
<P>
The next Dayton map shows me (W4APR-11) located <I> inside</I> the HARA arena at the location of the
APRS booth in the North Hall.  This position is exact because I used the APRStt
exact format of <B> B4927*1531D.</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="aprstt/TT-aprs.jpg">
<P>
HOW did I know my LAT/LONG?  <B> Easy!</B>.  Before Dayton, I 
copied the MAPS out of the Hamvention Program and added some simple LAT/LONG
tick marks along the edges of the map.  With one of these in my pocket, I 
could use DTMF and the 2x2 format to put myself anywhere on the map within 30 miles of the
center location of the APRStt recevier.  Or using the 
<A HREF="dayton/haramap.jpg"> HAMVENTION map </A> and the
4x4 APRStt format, I could put myself anywhere exactly. Here is the overall Dayton paper
map from the brochure with the one-mile grid tick-marks.
<P>
<IMG SRC="dayton/daytonmap.jpg">
<BR> Every event has a MAP.  Simply put the LAT/LONG minutes on the edges!
<P>
<B> LINUX IMPLEMENTATION:</B> When it comes to writing the final APRStt software,
it would be great if a version was written under LINUX and could then be run as an auxilliary
 application at your local IRLP node!  Rick, KB8DNR suggested that since the Linux
box is already up there, already listening for DTMF, and with my other 
<A HREF="avrs.html"> AVRS ideas </A>
will also already be linked to 144.39 via its own TNC, then its a perfect software only
upgrade!
<P>
<B><A HREF="aprstt/aprsttpl.txt">APRStt-PL</B></A> is an addon option [not even started yet] that adds "PL" 
decoding capability to APRStt.  It not only listens
for APRS messages formatted via Touch Tones and converts them to APRS packets on
144.39, but it also listens for PL tones on the input of the repeater.  Thus,
users can enable different PL tones on their HT's to signal any of 38 different
states, commands, or pre-arranged controls.  APRStt converts these also to packets
of the form:
<P>
<LI> W3VPR>APLXXX:> Heard PL 103
<P>
This packet shows that a PL tone of 103 was heard on the W3VPR repeater APRStt program.
The applications for this kind of signalling are only bound by the imagniation of
the users.  Since APRS knows where W3VPR repeater is located, it can use Vicinity
Plotting to let you see where this is occuring.  Or I can write a program that rings
a bell when PL 147 is heard.  My kids can then enter a PL of 147 on their $88
Alinco HT when they want to alert me to QSY to the W3VPR repeater to talk them.
ETC...  <A HREF="aprstt/aprsttpl.txt">See the details on this PL addition.</B></A> 
<P>
<B>DUAL TONE TEXT PAGING RADIOS:</B>

<B>DTMF Paging Radios:</B> This is another APRStt project.  
There are 300,000 DTMF text paging walkie talkies that were produced
in the 1990's.  We want to integrate them into the APRS system too.
In Mar 09, I made some progress on a pic-processor APRS-to DTMF gateway to convert
APRS packets to DTMF Text packets that can be displayed on any of the hundreds of thousands
of old DTMF text messaging radios of the 1990's (TH-78 and FT-51's etc)
<A HREF="aprs-dtmf-gate.html"><B>Read about the gateway</B></A>. 
<P>

<P>
Before the entry of the Kenwood D7 into the market, several 
manufacturers had experimented with using Touch Tone Dual Tone Signalling 
transmission and display in their handhelds.  Several models of Handhelds 
can send AND receive short TEXT fields via Touch Tones:
<BR>
<LI>Kenwood: TH-28A/48A/78A
<LI>Yeasu:   FT-11R,41R,51R
<LI>ICOM:    W31A
<P>
These radios can not only send TTones like any other HT, but they can also display
text sent via TTones from other radios.  The displays are quite limited to 6 or
8 characters on the screen at a time, but up to 10 such words can be sent.
For APRStt then, we can then define how APRStt can take APRS messages sent to one
of these users, convert it to DTSS tones and send them the message over the
repeater! <A HREF="aprstt/aprstttext.txt">CLick here for details</A>.
<P> 
APRStt.exe is written for any old 25 MHz or so DOS PC.  It was demonstrated at Dayton
2002 using only CW responses. <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/aprsttdayton.txt"> See Details</A>, 
but I have since added VOICE response via 8 simple resistors on the parallel LPT1 port. 

For Dayton, I released APRStt00.exe so that even without the DTMF chip, experimenters
could enter DTMF simulations from its PC keyboard and see the effect of the packets
it generates on the APRS channel...
