<B>ALL ANDE Operations have moved to the 
<A HREF="ande-ops.html">ANDE Ops web page</B></A>.  This was the combined 2007
USNA satellite operations page when we had both ANDE and RAFT spacecraft 
in orbit at the same time.
This page is retained for historical purposes. .
Similarly, the last few days of RAFT operations were all summarized on the
<A HREF="craft/save-raft.html">SAVE RAFT WEB PAGE!</B></A>. .
<P>
<HR SIZE=5 WIDTH="100%">
<P>
<B>ANDE Field-Day Operations:</B> ANDE and PCSAT (W3ADO-1) are available for Field Day operations,
both operate as standard APRS digipeaters on 145.825 MHz up and down, 1200 baud. 
. W3ADO-1 may work for a few lucky contacts since it is semi-operational. . But ANDE should be
fully operational, though it needs a small beam probably.  
. The PATH for ANDE is via ARISS just like for the ISS. . For PCSAT the
path is VIA W3ADO-1.
<P>

<B>RAFT has Re-entered:</B>  Deorbit was on 30 May 2007, and thanks to a big effort, 
the Radar Fence Transponder was demonstrated! . See  
<A HREF="craft/save-raft.html">the SAVE RAFT WEB PAGE!</B></A>. . 
<P>
<P>
<B>ANDE and RAFT STATUS:</B> .  On 6 April 07, PA3GUO restored RAFT from an upset 
and activated the packet-to-voice synthesizer. . See links below for operations. 
. RAFT was half way through its
mission and would de-orbit in August. . It's uplink was best in the dark. 
.  After 6 April began
a period of evening operations for the next few weeks. .  Command stations were needed
in the Southern USA states from Arizona to Georgia under the Space Radar Fence to help us
experiment with RAFT's radar transponder.
<P>
<B>ANDE and RAFT Speak. 10 Feb 07:</B> . Anyone can activate the RAFT voice module 
with a CONNECT RAFT, and then anyone else can send APRS messages to TALK to be spoken, but
both downlinks are weak. . Although ANDE also has the same voice circuits, they can only be activated
on each orbit by command station, and then, only after ANDE is awakened by user activity on the
channel. . Once activated, it speaks anyone's message to TALK.  Good luck! . Hear the 
<A HREF="ande/ande_11022007_2238.mp3"><B>PE1ITR and DK3WN</B></A> contact.
<A HREF="http://home.vianetworks.nl/users/hamoen/pa3guo/voice.html"><B> and others</B></A> in a voice contest.
<P>
<B>Packet-to-Voice Synthesizer Rules:</B>
<LI> On RAFT, someone must CONNECT RAFT to enable the Voice Synthesizer. (Presently, works best in the dark.)
<LI> On ANDE, a command station must enable the voice on each local pass.
<LI> Once enabled, RAFT or ANDE will speak any APRS formatted message to the callsign of TALK.
<LI> The synthesizer speaks the packet header as <B><i>XXXXXX says</i>...</B>
<LI> All message text is spoken in English with normal spelling.
<LI> CAPS are spelled best if the second byte is a <B>!</B> as in <B><i>W!B4APR</i></B>.
<LI> On ANDE, there can be a 10 second delay after yout TALK message is digipeated before it is spoken
<LI> See <A HREF="ande/ANDEcontract.txt"> User Service Agreement</A> for user activation details .

<P>

<B>STATUS 6 FEB 07:</B> For the last week RAFT has been enabled for PSK-31 ops.  
No joy has been
reported.  Also, several stations across the southern USA have been listening for the RADAR Fence
transponder.  PE1ITR succeeded in an even greater challenge, listening for the 4 milliwatt
local oscillator of the XP217 Radar Transponder.
<A HREF="craft/XP-217-detection-PE1ITR4feb07.JPG"><B> (see detection) </B></A>.  As of 6 Feb,
RAFT was placed back into packet-to-voice transponder mode (though RADAR testing can still continue
simultaneously).

<P>
<A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCSAT-1:</B></A> was restored to full operations in constellation with 
ANDE and RAFT on 1 Jan07 but experienced a reset on 18 Jan due to re-entering eclipse season.  
PCSAT-1 will not be available again until next October.

<P>
<A HREF="ande.html"><B>ANDE </B></A> and 
<A HREF="raft.html"><B>RAFT </B></A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/marscom.html"><B> MARScom</B></A> 
all involve US Naval Academy Student Projects.  RAFT and MARScom are
complete student spacecraft and the ANDE comm system was a student project. 
The 4th satelliite, 
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/fcal.html"><B>FCAL</B></A>, was built at NRL (like the ANDE shell)
but FCAL also contains an amateur radio cubesat for comms and telemetry.
These four satellites, operating in the Amateur Satellite Service were deployed from
Space Shuttle mission STS-116 on 21 December 2006.  
These missions are short due to their low altitude. Our AMSAT expert, N2WWD
predicts ANDE life of 15 months and RAFT only 5 months to May.  He was using
<A HREF="http://www.braxtontech.com">Astro-Dynamics Environment (ADE) software</A>.
See a <A HREF="http://wjz.com/local/local_story_347192330.html"><B>TV News Video</B></A>
as the students describe their work.

<P>
<B>THE 145.825 EDUCATIONAL SATELLITE NETWORK:</B> All APRS packet relay satellites are 
encouraged to join us on this common satellite frequency (after coordination with the IARU)
to help maintain this common space borne relay frequency for the convenience of students
and users
around the world.  ANDE and RAFT join 
<A hREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCSAT-1</B></A> as a 3 satllite constellation of
relay satellites on this frequency.  On 10 January, 
<A HREF="http://www.amsat.org.ar/?f=6"><B>Pehunesat</B></A> of Argentina joined
the constellation with both voice and packet.  UO-11 is still often heard as well.
See our <A HREF="buoy.html"><B>Ocean Buoy</B></A> student project as an example application
on this channel.  See the <A HREF="http://pcsat.aprs.org"><B> LIVE packets </B></A>
on this channel, collected by automated ground stations around the world.

<B>RAFT and MARScom Deployed:</B> RAFT and NMARS were deployed
<A HREF="craft/Deploy-RAFT0156z.JPG"><B>(see map)</B></A>
 at 0156z on 21 Dec 06 from STS-116.
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/craft/operations/RAFT%20DeployZ.wmv"><B>See 600k video</B></A>,
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/craft/operations/RAFT%20Deploy.wmv"> (or 5M original)</A>.
There appear to be significant torques
applied to the picosats.  KG4QWC at NRL has
counted an initial 83 RPM for NMARS and 39 RPM for RAFT.  At this high
spin rate, the configuration of the 4' HF long wire antennas is of interest.
See a stitched <A HREF="craft/photos/frame%20all.JPG"><B>Freeze Frame</B></A> of the deploy
or full size frames <A HREF="craft/STS116-RAFT-321-009x.JPG"><B>009</B></A> and
<A HREF="craft/STS116-RAFT-door321-010x.JPG"><B>010</B></A>.  
. The initial spin rate quickly decayed as shown below:

<B>FCAL DEPLOYED, ANDE-MAA STUCK IN CAN:</B>  17 hours after launch,
at 1823z just east of 
New Zealand, the CAPE-ICU deployed 
<A HREF="ande/Deploy-ANDE1822z.JPG"><B>(see map)</B></A>
and 40 seconds later the ICU was supposed to separate into
5 pieces (3 parts and 2 satellites).  In the photo below you can see that
FCAL floated out of its half as planned, but ANDE-MAA 
appears to be stuck in its half of the can (the lower right).  The separation ring
is in the middle just a foot or so from the ANDE cannister.

<P>
<B>UPDATE: . ANDE Lives, and RAFT Responds!</B> on the 21 Dec, 2200z pass, RAFT responded to 
commands and SPOKE, and with all the noise on the channel, ANDE woke up and sent
out one packet with temperatures showing a balmy 25 to 28 deg C.  ANDE-MAA had apparently
drifted out of the can about 31 minutes after deploy and is fully operational  
<A HREF="ande/OPSreport1.txt"><B> (See report)</B></A>..  By 9 Jan, it appears that ANDE has no spin
<A HREF="ande/Sun-All.GIF"><B>(see plot)</B></A>, and
<A HREF="ande/CoreTemps.GIF"><B>(temps)</B></A>. 
<P>

Subsequent passes of both spacecraft improved and we gained command of both
ANDE and RAFT.  Signals are weaker than PCSAT-1 and by mid-day and most systems checked out, 
we authorized user access on a limited basis.  
ANDE cooled to -10C on the outside the first full day.  But later stabalized to an internal 
temperarure of about 15 deg C with peaks on the shell of 40 C at the end of a sun-side pass.  
See the <A HREF="ande/ande-report2.txt"><B> report-2</B></A>.
<P>

<B>RAFT SPIN ANALYSIS:</B> It is easy to hear the high spin rate on RAFT when the downlink 
transmitter is on.  We can turn it on for the XP-217 radar fence transponder or for the PSK-31 
downlink or for voice.
In all cases, you can hear the spin modulation.  Initially the spin was 39 RPM as observed by KG4QWC.
Observations on 14 Jan by PA3GUO show it is down to 25 RPM as recorded in this image below
and his <A HREF="craft/RAFTspin14jan-pa3guo.mp3"><B>MP3 file</B></A>.
<P>
<IMG SRC="craft/RAFTspin14jan-pa3guo_25rpm.jpg" height= 450 width=600>
<P>
<B>LIMITED USE AUTHORIZED:</B> . Users may use these spcecraft in accordance with the current 
<A HREF="ande/ANDEcontract.txt"><B> User Service Agreement</B></A>.  Supported modes are:
<LI>ANDE and RAFT as digipeaters of all packets using the paths of ARISS, APRSAT, RELAY, WIDE or WIDEn-N.
<LI>ANDE packet-to-Voice when enabled by command station
<LI>RAFT packet-to-voice (or PSK-31) when enabled by someone CONNECTING to RAFT
<P>
<B>RAFT Speaks!:</B> Hear samples from
<A HREF="craft/pa3guo-voice.mp3"><B> PA3GUO</B></A>,

 .  Users are cautioned that unattended uplinks are not generally authorized and uses must not
overlaod the uplink so that command stations cannot get in.

<P>
<B>DO NOT TRANSMIT a voice packet to RAFT or ANDE if you cannot hear packets from the spacecraft!</B>
The downlink is very weak and we cannot afford anyone transmitting in the blind and blocking
command access.  With an OSCAR array, even command stations cannot hear RAFT below 10 degrees.
Omni stations may only hear it 2% of total pass times during the center minute or so of
a rare overhead pass. Transmitting speech packet is ONLY authorized in accordance with 
the <i>current</i> <A HREF="ande/ANDEcontract.txt"><B> User Service Agreement</B></A>.

<B>INITIAL ORBIT RAFT Telemetry from W7KKE, USNA, and VE4NSA:</B>  Volts were 8.4 in the sun, 
dropped to 7.3 volts by middle of eclipse on first pass over East Coast USA.  
We were seeing shut downs (at 6.6V) on each eclipse for the first 10
hours, but now JN1GKZ captured a packet over Japan that shows we are now charged
up enough to make it through eclipse and had been running for 529 minutes.  Now
ZL1AOX in New Zealand has captured our first Sun data and we have over 250 mA
of solar current and volts up to 8.7.    
Here is screen shot of first TLM over USNA:

<B>ANDE/RAFT CONJUNCTIONS:</B> The spacecraft separated from the Space Shuttle STS116 
on 21 December and were in range of each other for about 15 days and
then rejoined to within a few km on 10 Feb about 1400z (in range of each other for 6 days).
As RAFT speeds up as it decays faster, the next joint ops will only last only 3 days 
about 7 March, then again on 26 March, 11 April, 25 April and 5 May.
When they are in view of each other, exciting dual hop packet relays are 
possible as shown in the following graphic:
<P>
<IMG SRC="pec/PC2-PC1%20long.GIF" >
<P>


<P>
<B>ANDE and RAFT Science Missions:</B>  The NRL science mission of ANDE is to measure the
density of the upper atmosphere by precise tracking of the orbit decay by the Maui 
Laser Ranging Tracking Station.  The Comm system provides important telemetry on the
attitude and temperature of the spacecraft.  RAFT carries a 216.98 MHz
receiver/transmitter to demonstrate self-location techniques when it flies
through the Space Surveillance Network radar fence across the southern USA.  When this
experiment is activated, users will hear a 1 second ping when it flies through the fence.

<P>
<B>ANDE and RAFT Communications:</B>  ANDE and RAFT carry packet radio communications
systems operating in the Amateur Satellite Service and join with other USNA APRS digipeating 
satellites such as PCSAT-1 and PCSAT2.  ANDE and RAFT will respond to the path alias of 
APRSAT and ARISS an other common APRS aliases.  This is so that users do not have
to reconfigure their path between satellites or between their ISS groundstation.  The
following frequencies are used by these two spacecraft:
<BR>
<LI>ANDE Side A: 145.825 Digipeater up/downlink 1200 baud packet
<LI>ANDE Side B: 145.825 downlink (backup to side A only)
<LI>RAFT System: 145.825 Digipeater up/downlink 1200 baud packet
<LI>RAFT PSK-31: 28.120 HF PSK-31 uplink -downlink on 145.825
<LI>NMARS packet: 27.9625 USB downlink and 148.975 uplink
<P>

<B>ANDE Operations: </B> When ANDE is awake, it has four operating capabilities, telemetry, 
Digipeating, a Packet-to-Voice Synthesizer and Lasers.  It sleeps 90% of the time
and only wakes up for 2 seconds out of every 16 seconds to see if it hears
any packets.  If none, then it goes back to sleep to save power. (it has no solar power
system, only primary batteries).  Once it awakens, it is useable as a digipeater until 
1 minute after the last packet heard.  The batteries should last a year.

<P>
<B>ANDE Lasers:</B>  The lasers are in the near infrared and outside of normal vision, 
though we could see some "red" though only about like a standard red LED in brightness..
(Thought the lasers are 1 Watt and blinding in the infrared!).  They are probably not
visible to the eye, but should show up in a CCD camera.  The Lasers require a SYSOP 
to activate and since their main function is to be tracked by the Maui Laser Ranging 
station, the lasers will probably only be 
turned on by our volunteer Hawaii command stations.  
The lasers are nearly omni directional, so the 1 Watt power is dispersed over a large area
and weak in any one direction.  Visibly, not any brighter than a single standard LED.  
I doubt any amateur astronomer would be able to see it unless they have a CCD camera.  
See <A HREF="ande/lasers.txt"><B>laser info</B></A> for details.

<P>
<B>ANDE Packet-to-Voice Synthesizer:</B>  This experiment is carried on both RAFT and ANDE,
but on ANDE, this circuit can only be activated by a SYSOP command station and only on
a single-pass-at-a-time basis since it goes back to sleep and resets everything after the
pass is over.  This circuit on ANDE may only get used if the RAFT  one is inoperative.


<P>
<B>RAFT OPERATIONS:</B> RAFT has four operational modes.  Its primary science mission
is to demonstrate the self-location of a tiny satellite in orbit by detecting its own
passage through the 216.98 MHz radar fence across the southern USA.   The secondary
missions are communication experiments in the Amateur Satellite Service and are available
to radio amateurs worldwide:
<LI> APRS Packet Digipeater:  relays users APRS packets
<LI> Voice Synthesizer:  speaks packets sent to it (when enabled)
<LI> PSK-31 Transponder:  relays PSK-31 signals from 28.120 MHz +/- 3 KHz (when enabled)
<P>

<B> RAFT APRS Digipeater: </B>  This simple AX.25 digital repeater is just like the ones
flown on PCSAT-1, PCSAT2 and ANDE and also as ARISS on the ISS.  It defaults to off, but
will be left ON as long as battery state permits.  It responds to the common digipeater
aliases of "APRSAT" and "ARISS" so that users do not have to frequently change their
transmitter settings.

<P>
<B> RAFT Voice Synthesizer: </B>  RAFT also has the text-to-speech synthesizer so that it 
can speak packets sent to it.  The format for such a packet is standard APRS message
format.  Simply address your message to the speech synthesizer callsign of TALK.  
If the voice syhtnesizer is
activated, it will speak the packet.  It ignores the AX.25 packet header and also the
APRS overlaying protocol and converts all of that overhead to simply "XXXXX says:" 
and then continues with the original packet text converted to voice.
<P>
To save power, the voice synthesizer is normally off.  But if it has been enabled by
the RAFT team, then it is available for activation by anyone.  To activate the voice
synthesizer for the duration of a pass, any user may initiate a normal 1200 baud packet
connection to the RAFT callsign.  The "connection" turns on the CONNECTED LED on the
spacecraft TNC and this in turn activates the voice synthesizer as long as that person
remains connected.  Notice that this station cannot then send  unconnected APRS
voice packets unless he has two packet systems or fakes a disconnect and then begins
working in UI mode.
<P>

<B>RAFT PSK-31 Transponder:</B>  The PSK-31 transponder is a 10 meter SSB receiver on 
28.120 to 28.1235 MHz.  Any PSK-31 signals in that band will be demodulated to audio on
the RAFT spacecraft and transmitted to the gound on the RAFT VHF FM transmitter.  This
way everyone in the footprint will see the same uplink passband as everyone else.
This eliminates any difference in Doppler among all the stations on the uplink.  If
signals are clean, then as many as 30 simultaneous users my use the transponder.

<P>
The PSK-31 transponder is activated just like the voice experiment.  
If the SYSOP has enabled the transponder, then any connect request from any user
to the callsign of RAFT will activate the transponder as long as that station
maintains the connection.  At the end of the pass, it will time out and turn
off agiain.  Packet has no function in this case except that the connection is what keeps
the PSK-31 transponder ON.

<P>
Note:  We do not expect great performance in this transponder mostly due to inadequate
RFI shielding inside the small 5" cubeasat.  To make everything fit, we could not have
any metal shielding between all the various modules, and so the sensitive HF uplink
receiver is only 1/2" away from the very noisy CPU of the TNC.  This creates over
20 dB of digital hash noise floor.  So it may take a strong signal to hear anything
on the HF uplink.  Keep expectations low...

<P>

<P>
<B>JOINT OPERATIONS:</B> Since RAFT caries an identical packet digipeater as PCSAT-1 and
ANDE, users should look for opportunities when one satellite can be used to relay packets
through the other.  Of course, if too many people try this, then no one will be
successful because the users are using 50 watts and the satellites would hve to 
hear the weak 2 watt signal of the other satellite.  But it is possible, especially when
the geometry is favorable where one spacecraft is over the ocean and the other one
is just barely in view of users.  The image below shows a PCSAT-2 to PCSAT-1
double hop.
<P>
<IMG SRC="pec/PC2-PC1%20long.GIF">
<P>
<B>January 2007 JOINT-OPS:</B> PCSAT-1 is basically inoprative except when in full sun at 
mid-day in the northern hemisphere due to a negative power budget.  But during 2 weeks
in January, Sun angles improve and PCSAT-1 will come back to full operation.  That will
be an exciting time.  There will be another such period in mid April.
See <A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCSAT-1</B></A>.

<P>

<B>RAFT Mailbox Experiment:</B>  RAFT also has an internal PBBS that could be used for
special events or experiments, though it may not have the power budget to keep it on.
If anyone has any ideas here, let us know.
<P>
<IMG SRC="http://www.aprs.org/aprs/passes-iss.GIF">
<P>
<B>SCHEDULING CONSTRAINTS:</B> RAFT operations are constrained by power budget.  It has
solar panels on all sides and so it should have the same average sun throughout its
short mission life.  So hopefully it will either work or not.  But some modes demand
more power than others.  Here are the priority of operations:

<LI> STANDBY Mode:  Conserving power.  Only available to SYSOP.  A beacon and 1 minute telemetry may be heard.
<LI> RAFT Radar Fence Experiments.  Hight TX current for 1 minute when in use.  Will be rare.
<LI> DIGIPEATER ON:  This increaseas the TX load.  It will be on whenever possible.
<LI> VOICE SYNTHESIZER:  Adds 40 mA but only when in use.  Voice TX uses a lot of TX power.
<LI> PSK-31 TRANSPONDER:  Adds full TX power for 8 minutes at a time.  Very power hungry.  WIll only be on for special events or experiments.

<P>
<B>VOLUNTEER GROUND STATIONS:</B>  Since RAFT has no onboard computer for whole-orbit
telemetry capture we are dependent on volunteer ham radio ground stations 
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/aa6rr.jpe">(see typical photo - AA6RR)</A> and
<A HREF="http://es.geocities.com/eb8auu/aprs/index.htm">(EA8BQD in the Canaries)</A>
 for telemetry feeds to the APRS Internet system
for live distribution. Any APRS station can be a satgate just like they are normally for
operation of an IGate.  There is no difference.
<LI><B> 1200 baud SatGates: . .</B> Feed RAFT telemetry and all other packets to the APRS-Internet System

<P>
<B>SETTING UP A SATGATE:</B></A> You can use any APRS program to feed satellite 
data to the APRS-Internet system (APRS-IS) in the normal manner like any IGate.  
But if you dont
want to mess with all the APRS system, you can build a simple SatGate using only
the ALOGGER program.  See <A HREF="ande/ANDEsatgate.txt"><B>building an ALOGGER Satgate</B></A>.
See the <A HREF="http://satgate.aprsca.net:14701/"><B> status of other SATgates</B></A>.
Click to (<A HREF="http://www.billdiaz.dynip.com/ASatLogger.htm"><B>
download</B></A>) Alogger. .
You can also set up a satgate using any APRS client software.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/hamradio/je9pel/uiview32.htm"><B>JE9PEL's page</B></A> on how to set
up UIview as a satgate.
<P>

<B>SIMPLE SATGATE ANYONE CAN DO:</B> Although it appears to take an OSCAR array to bring 
in ANDE and RAFT packets, we do not expect most satgates to have one.  We take advantage
of the global distribution of the APRS SATgate system to combine the outputs of
dozens of stations so all we need is each station to hear one or two packets, and then
we can all see all of them on the APRS internet system.  The best antenna for this
is on the gound in your backyard.  Just make a 57" vertical over a large chicken 
wire ground plane.  This becomes a 3/4 wave (50 ohm) vertical with almost 7 dB of 
gain above 30 degrees.
<P>
No, you won't hear most packets, but you WILL hear a few, a few times a day, and that is
what we need.  The figure below shows the gain pattern of such an antenna.  Combined
with the fact that the satellite is 10 dB closer to you when overhead than on 
the horizon, gives you a total of 17 dB gain advantage to those few packets.  Those
few packets combined with those few from everyone else should give us good continuous 
data.  Since it is on the ground, it is not that bad of a winter project!  No moving
parts, no tuning for doppler, and antomatic IGate, and you are done.  The GREEN plot is
the 3/4 wave compared to the RED which is a 1/4 wave.  Make the ground plane screen
 as big as you can.  Maybe 6 feet or more?

<B>RAFT:</B>  See a <A HREF="raft.html"><B> complete description of RAFT</B></A>.  
This  is just one of many <A HREF="satstation.html"><B> Naval Academy compatible spacecraft</B></A>
and several  <A HREF="astars.html"><B>other compatible satellite projects</B></A>
operating in the Amateur Satellite Service.  The following
map shows the stations that have volunteered to support the special telemetry downlinks from
PCSAT2:  
<P>
<IMG SRC="pec/GndStns.gif">
<P>

<B>User Service Agreement:</B>  RAFT cannot live up to its full potential unless all users
use it as designed.  Therefore like other Naval Academy Satellites, we ask that all users
subscribe to the <A HREF="craft/RAFT-itu.txt"> RAFT User Service Agreement</A>.  If you agree
to use RAFT in accordance with the guidelines posted there, then you may use the
spacecraft. 
<P>

<B>RAFT TELEMETRY:</B>  RAFT generates routine housekeeping telemetry once a minute.
There are only 5 telemetry values.
<LI> Battery Volts
<LI> Solar Power Current
<LI> Battery Current
<LI> Load Current
<LI> Spacecraft Temperature.
<P>
Since only 5 channels are available, we used a trick with the termperature sensors to
see other data.  If the PSK-31 transponder is on, then the thermister that is
transmitted is the Transmitter.  If it is normal mode, then the thermister is
on the spaceframe.
<P>

When decoded, <A HREF="craft/RAFTeqns.gif"><B>(See Telemetry Equations and format) </B></A> ,
here is a screen snapshot of the typical telemetry data.  Notice that both RAFT 
and MARScom show on the same screen.
<P>
<IMG SRC="craft/RAFT-tlmSCRN.GIF">
<P>
The following screen capture shows what ANDE telemetry looks like.  Notice that there are
two columns for the A and B side (ANDE-1 and ANDE-2).  Side B reports on the bottom half
of ANDE and side A reports the top half.   The head of the column shows
which packet (00,01,10,11) contains that telemetry.  In this capture, ANDE was
in the dark because you can see that the graphics to the lower 
right does not show any solar sensors illuminated.  The other graphics shows temperatures,
in this case, as a cool blue.   Otherwise most of these values are gyberish
and not real.  The currents in the upper right are HIGH and are shown in RED.  NOrmally
we expect to see values in the tens of mA.  You will see 400 mA if a TX is captured.

<B>EXAMPLE NETWORK DIAGRAM:</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="pec/AMSAT-IS.gif">
<P>
Ground Stations can be simple or complex.  A simple 19" whip over a ground plane 
works very well and can see the satellite above about 15 degrees.
  A full tracking station down to the horizon may get more data, but may not be worth
the expense.  However, it should be noted that RAFT does not have cross polarized antennas,
so there will be nulls in the pattern.  But there is a tiny magnet on board that should
orient those antnnas along the Earths Magnetic field.  The plot below suggests the
orientation that a mid-latitude station will see if looking west (or east).  The satellite
will be mostly horizontal to the south, and tend towards vertical to the North.  Since
RAFT is deployed from the Shuttle (coming back from the ISS), it will be in an orbit
similar to the ISS (just lower and faster)...
<P>
<IMG SRC="craft/MAG40w.gif">
<P>
<B>FIXED OR AUTOMATED STATIONS AND ANTENNAS:</B> If there are enough ground stations, 
then trackign stations are not required, since when one station loses it on the
low horizon, it should be over another ground station somewhere else.
  See the plot below
comparing the gain of a 1/4 wave whip with a 3/4 wave whip.  This is live data
obtained from a 1/4 wave and 3/4 wave whip (scaled to GPS size and using the
GPS constellation over 12 hours to provide all-sky signals):
<P>
<IMG SRC="http://www.aprs.org/g34-14.jpg" >
<P>
<P>
Much experimentation in this area is needed.  Here is a plot of the theoretical
EZ-NEC produced gains of three whip antennas including the path loss due to range.
THis shows the 3/4 wave antenna to not begin working until above 30 deg, but
I routinely capture some data above 20....  Better than shown here.
<P>
<IMG SRC="http://www.aprs.org/gainplot.gif">
<P>
Bottom line, whats the best antenna?  Depends on how many people are collecting
data from which directinos....  There are enough of you and 
enough different stations for us to find out!
