<B> USNA Satellite Ground Station, </B> Bob Bruninga, WB4APR
<P>
This unscheduled contact with International Space Station Commander LCOL Bill McArthur  was made on 
Satruday at 1355 EST
while we were doing routine preparations for a pass of the USNA Satellite PCSAT2
(which is attached to the outside of the Space Station).  Bill caught us by surprise 
as it is very rare for them to find time to get on the radio.  And we caught him
just as our antennas reached zero degrees elevation and ISS was passing east way
out over the Atlantic.

Only the ISS side of the conversation was recorded by Al, KD4SFF in South Carolina, 
since he could only hear the downlink.  Below is a transcript which includes what
we were saying to him on the uplink.

<LI>73's - is an old morse code abbreviation for <i>Best Wishes</i>

<LI>QSL - means <i>I acknowledge receipt of your last transmission.</i>

Too bad he was Army, but then when we win on Saturday, we will
call him back and <i>crow</i> a little...
