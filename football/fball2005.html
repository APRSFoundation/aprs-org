<B>13th Company Runners:</B> Last year at noon Friday, 2 Dec 2005, 100 midshipmen from the 
13th Company began running the Army/Navy
 game football 130 miles from  Annapolis to the stadium in Philly.  By 7:30 AM the next
morning it had arrived in the stadium parking lot (This last image captured at 0930):
<P>

<B>USNA Radio Club Communications:</B> For the last 22 years, the 
<A HREF="http://www.usna.edu/AmateurRadio/"><B>USNA Radio Club, W3ADO</B></A>(the oldest
ECA at USNA since 1928), with the
help of the AERO Satellite Lab maintains comms and tracking of the runners using the same kind of amateur 
radio APRS position reporting  technology used in the Academy's 
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/football/pcsat2.html"> <B>PCSAT2</B></A> satellite on the International Space Station.
Although the USNA radio club was closed during 2005 in the move to reduce the number
of small clubs at the Academy, the small cadre of FCC licensed 
midshipmen still supported this event in memory of past club president 
ENS Dan Trembula KG4DRA who just passed away just the week before after his long fight with cancer.
This event and Midshipmen Sea Trials are two of the main Brigade support activities for the club.
<P>
<B><i>Go Navy - Beat Army </i> with the Crew of Space Station!</B> On saturday, the USNA radio
club made contact with the crew of the space station and they mentioned
the upcoming Army/Navy ball game!  <A HREF="ISS-W3ADO.html"><B>Hear the audio</B></A>.
Too bad he was supporting the wrong team...

<BR>Then on 1 Dec, they were doing this:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="http://www.aprs.org/football/football/Dueling.GIF">
<BR>But we got even the next morning on Ball Run day by loading the same bulletin
into PCSAT2 also.  So not only did we have two satellites saying GO NAVY, but one of
them was on his ship!

This map is now zoomed into the area between Oxford PA and Philly which covers
the route from about midnight to sunrise.
The mids do there overnight staging from the fire station there.  Look for the 
 <B>FBALL</B> and <B>CHASE</B>  shuttle vans on the map below.   You will see other
amateur radio operators also using this technology on the map.
The ball usually makes it to Oxford around midnight.  Then on to arrive in Philly by sunrise.
The map below is the USNA tracking system [since the ball has arrived, 
live tracking is over and this map is a Frozen Snapshot]

These two links above are to the global Automatic Position Reporting System (APRS)and the FINDU
data base maintained entirely by Amateur Radio Operators.  We can track over 27,000
ham radio operators worldwide.  All you need to know is their callsign and they must
have a GPS connected to their HAM radio and these links can find them.  The aerial photos
are from the USGS Database and the web page overlays the live GPS coordinates on them.

These images are transmitted back live via Amateur radio using what is called SSTV, Slow Scan TV.  HAMS have been doing this for over 30 years, but now with WEB technology, we can instantly post these live images to our WEB page too...

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/football/aprn.html">APRN BACKGROUND:</A></B> APRN (Automatic Picture Relay Network) is a live amateur radio channel for the transmission of remote KEN-CAM images.  We can even automatically place the station on the map if he uses an attached GPS unit.  Thus this APRN web page is automatic and 
catalogs, indexes and makes available images instantly.  There is no 
better mechanism than APRN for diseminating real-time, in-the-field 
images from amateur radio operators in support of emergencies or public 
service events.
APRN augments the worldwide <A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/football/aprs.html">APRS </A> amateur radio position reporting and mesaging system by giving vision to remote and mobile operations.  <P><B>APRN </B>is a concept presented by Bob Bruninga, WB4APR at the Digital
