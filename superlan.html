This page was written in 2005 while trying to come up with new ideas for handling large
congested areas.  The success of the <A HREF="fix14439.html"><B>New-N paradigm</B></A> was
so good that these ideas were never implemented.  THey are retained here for historical purposes.</B>
<P>

<B>SUMMARY:</B>  This pages muses how <B>SUPER-SITES</B> could be used to increase the coverage and user area
from the 60 ALOHA limit for typical multi-hop 1200 baud to as many as 180 stations for a SUPER-LAN
with UHF output or even 480 or more if operating at 9600 baud.
</B>
<P>

Local users
still use 1200 baud on 144.39 within their ALOHA limit on VHF to their nearest 60 local users.  But clusters
of these ALOHA LAN's can be combined into SUPER-SITES that listen to all the lowere-tier digis
and combine what they hear into a single full-duplex UHF output.  For users willing to operate at 9600
baud, almost 1000 can be handled.  Users can operate normally on 144.39 and see their local
ALOHA area, or operate cross band by tuning in the UHF downlink  from the SUPER-SITE, and see everything.
Super-Users
are typically fixed stations with fixed gain antennas pointed at the SuperSite since it might be
some distance away.  Even if 9600 baud is used, the D7 and D700 radio are 
perfect Super-User systems at 9600 baud for FIXED stations and portable stations.  But do <i>not</i>
think that it will ever make any sense to try to use one in APRS mode to the front panel screen 
while moble. (see discussion later).  This SUPER-SITE system is only intended for large screen
displays and communications over wider areas than normally possible on the 1200 baud ALOHA limited
system.

Just to present a hypothetical visualization of the potential of this kind of supersite, the above
map shows how it is geographically best situated to make the best use of this 
kind of two-tier system.  Of course PHG circles are just circles and in the real world there are
all kinds of blockages and black holes.  But the PHG circles do show which sites could be
super-sites, since the SUPER-SITE only has to hear the other digis, it does not have to hear
the users!  Note:  These PHG circles are the reliable range to mobiles.  The FIXED-site ranges
are actually <i>double</i> what are shown here.
<P>
<IMG SRC="SuperLan.gif">
<P>
There are all kinds of advantages of the SUPER-SITE:
<LI> Operates full duplex for a 2 fold increase in throughput
<LI> Amortizes TX/TR delays for another 30% increase in throughput
<LI> Reduces by 1, the number of hops required on 144.39 (reduces the dupes by a factor of 4 or more)
<LI> Has NO DUPES at the second level since the router eliminates all dupes just like on the APRS-IS
<LI> Can Operate at 9600 baud for an additional 8 fold increase in throughput
<LI> Is an overlay system that requires no changes to existing operations
<LI> Requires no coordination or cooperation from lower-tier digis
<LI> Is all implemented at one site (just need one motivated GURU to do it)
<LI> Operating cross band at 9600 baud is fully compatible with the D7 and D700 Radios
<P>

In fact, you will notice that the combined effect of just going cross band, eliminating one
hop, and amortizing TXD's can multiply the size of an ALOHA LAN by a great amount
 over the maximum possible 60 station typical multi-hop ALOHA (remember, the 60 user ALOHA
can only be achieved with all stations direct and all hearing each other, so a real
1200 baud system actually performs at much less than 60).
We can gain so much capacity by reducing hop count that the hard part will be how to find that many
users on RF to be able to combine.  Changing some of the RF receivers
to links to distant other areas and Super-Sites could even be supported.
<P>

<B>ANTENNA AND RF DESIGN:</B>
It will take some interesting and challenging design of antennas at the supersite, but some of
the beams can be put at ground level or over the other side of the hill through hundreds
of feet of coax, since sensitivity is not an issue at this supersite, but beam directivity
is paramount.  Also, corner Reflectors are easy to build and have excellent front-to back
directivity.  Remember, it only takes about 10 dB differention between signals for the
FM capture effect to assure a good receive in the intended direction even though there
is other QRM on the channel.  This use of directional antennas is exactly how the Cell phone 
industry packs in more users once they have saturated with omnis.
<P>
<B>ROUTER SOFTWARE:</B>
Notice also that the central router PC that interfaces to all these TNC's is no
different than a typical IGate.  It feeds one copy of everything it hears
to the UHF super-site channel.  It maintians a local list for each low-tier digi
and then routes any messages or acks between the needed TNC's.  One other thing it
does is to bundle groups of packets into 7-packet UHF TX bursts with 300 ms
pauses (at 1200 baud) to allow for user TNC's to transmit.  At 9600 baud a 0.1
seccond pause is needed to make sure not to overload the RX buffers in the D700 and D7 radios when
operating at 9600 baud.  This is only a 10% penalty to assure full functionality
of this very common APRS radio.
<P>
<IMG SRC="SuperLanAGWPE.gif">
<P>
Wes points out that a PC and 2 stereo sound cards can replace 4 of the needed TNC's.
I wonder if 4 sound cards can do the entire job of 8 TNC's?  If so, then
it is only takes a PC and a bunch of radios to do this!  And only 1 Watt HT's can suffice since
they only have to communicate with the other digis, not the users. (but at such
a high site, intermod might make such simple trasnceivers useless) though the attenuators
might reduce most signals to managable levels....
<P>
<B>TIMING:</B> One of the most important aspects of the ROUTER software  will
be to bundle packets into bunches of 7 at a time with at least a 300 ms (at 1200) or 100 ms drop
before the next bundle.  This is important for two reasons:
<LI> First it makes sure that the buffers in the D7 and D700 are not overrun
<BR>.....Remember that AX.25 adds as much as 20% or more overhead to every packet
<LI> Second, it allows for the Carrier-Detect in all SUPER-USER stations to periodically see a clear
channel and an opportunity to transmit.  Even though they are operating full duplex
and cross band, some TNC's and radios can't do this and need to see the carrier drop.
<P>
<B>LOW-TIER DIGIS:</B> Notice that no coordination or cooperation of the low-tier digis
is needed.  However, to live up to the full potential of APRS in this
area, the <B>New n-N Paradigm </B> must be implemented first or this is a waste of time.  
This is necessary whether or not this super-site is ever built, because reducing the QRM 
and getting everyone to drop back and operate only within their local ALOHA range is the 
only way to assure end user reliability.  
See the <A HREF="fix14439.html"><B> New n-N Paradigm</B></A> details.
<P>
<B>USING THE D-700 or D7:</B>
Of course any radio that can operate cross band can be used at 1200 baud, but at 9600,
the D7 and D700 are perfect for FIXED site 9600 baud Super-Users since they have the built-in TNC, operate
at 9600 baud and can work in cross-band mode.  But the only way to make sense of this RF feed
of over 300 potential users is to be runnning in PACKET mode and displaying the data on a PC.
<P>
It makes no sense to try to use these radios in APRS mode as a Super-User while mobile for many reasons
as enumerated below:
<LI> The radio only displays 40 stations (the typical ALOHA channel limit)
<LI> A driver and the human mind cannot assimilate 500 things going on at once
<LI> 9600 baud on these radios has a 7 dB RF performance penalty compared to 1200 baud
<LI> Mobile multipath degrades 9600 baud operation much worse than 1200 baud
<LI> Mobile multi-path is 3 times worse on UHF 
<LI> The TXdelay at 9600 baud is 5 times longer than the actual APRS data 
<P>
Of course, the mobile user with a LAPTOP in the car can monitor the 9600 baud
channel if he is close enough to make up for all the disadvantages, and of course,
if he stops the car, and points a beam at the Super-Site and uses a laptop, then
he can quickly become a Super-User with no penalty.
<P>
<B>TXD DELAY:</B> Note that the 9600 baud Super-User will always want to shorten the default TXD delay
of his D7 or D700 radio in order to vastly reduce the overhead when operating at 9600 baud.
Either radio can be set to any TXD.  But it is important to note that only the TH-D7(g) has 
the ability to change the TXD while in APRS mode from the APRS front panel menu.  But agiain
we dont see any proactical applications of trying to use the D7 as a mobile Super-User
while in APRS mode anyway...  
<P>
<B>1296 MHz OPERATION!</B> And lastly, since the 9600 baud D700 radio will probably be
an excellent SUPER-USER radio, and since the UHF band might be needed for cross-LAN
links, the SUPER-SITE owner might instead decide to put the SUPER-DIGI output on 1296!
This is just fine, because the D700 receives on the 1296 band too!  Thus the only person
that has to purchase a 1296 MHz transmitter is the super-site.  Everyone else uses their
D700 just fine.  And since they are fixed location users, the small high gain beams
at 1296 are easy to use.  This opens up the 440 band for cross links between Super Sites
while every channel continues to work full time full duplex with no interference.
Just a thought...
<P>
<B>POST-SCRIPT:</B>  Remember, this SUPER-SITE cocept began as a way to use UHF and 9600
baud to get to an order of magnitude increase in throughpput for APRS.  But during the course
of this analysis, it soon became clear that an order of magnitude could already be obtained
by simply eliminating the exponential dupes created by each hop, going to UHF, going
full duplex and amortizing the TX delays.  In fact, in very high density areas, such as
the LA Basin, where over 300 users are within 100 miles of 10,000 foot digis that
can cover the entire area direct, it is possible to get a throughput for all 300 
users using this concept at 1200 baud with no first-tier digis at all!
