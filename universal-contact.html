<B>Universal Connectivity-by-callsign Workshop:</B>  This workshop was held 18 Sept 2011
 at the ARRL/TAPR <A HREF="http://tapr.org/dcc.html"><B>Digital Communications Conference</B></A>
and <B><i>WOW!</B></i> was it an exciting event.  Just some of the existing connectivity is
shown here to the right.  

<P>
There are many pieces to this challenge, and
so this particular web page will simply be a directory to other areas involved in this project.
If you know of others, let us know!
<P>

<B>Universal Connectivity by callsign:</B> WB4APR, Bob introduced the concept of Universal Connectivity by callsign.  (Both Text and Voice)
His two talks were <A HREF="avrs/DCC/AVRS-slidesDCC2011.ppt"><B>Why AVRS? </B></A> and the
other showing all the <A HREF="avrs/DCC/DCC-universal-contact.ppt">
<B>Universal Connectivity support</B></A> available in APRS.

<P>
<B>D-Star Considerations:</B> WA4KFZ, Mark Braunstein followed through from his D-Star introduction talk the previous
day about all the potential for D-Star to evolve in support of greater connectivity and user
friendliness.

<P>
<B>ALE and HFlink.com</B> WB4AKK, Ken Heitner explained how ALE for HF provides another 
     <B><i>contact-by-callsign</i></B> system that couild join this concept.  In particular
     the global status of the ALE HFNET is also available on line.  See
     <A HREF="http://hfink.COM"><B>HFlink.COM</B></A>.

<P>
<B>Automatic Voice Relay System, AVRS:</B> AB0OO, John Gorkos from Atlanta 
then blew us all away by demonstrating his
working version of AVRS.  <A HREF="avrs.html"><B>AVRS!</B></A>  
is the signalling and contact establishment part of the ham radio 
<B>Universal Voice Contact System </B> equivalent to the
<A HREF="aprs-messaging.html"><B>Universal Ham Radio Text Messaging </B></A>
initiative.  Both of these initiatives attempt to cross connect all ham radio
systems so that only a callsign is needed to establish TEXT or VOICE contact.
For Voice, we are trying to cross connect all of the VoIP ham radio link Programs 
(IRLP, ECHOlink, WIRES, D-STAR, Asterix, etc)!</B> . 


<P>

<B>D-Star VOIP CrossConnects:</B> Other information was presented showing how D-Star 
callsign-to-callsign connectivity can be used for making these Voice contact, not only
within D-Star, but also across gateways and joint-nodes so that D-Star can talk to
Echolinks and IRLP's and ALE and jsut about any other voice network.  This web page
shows how 
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWkFp7S2pXY"><B>VK5ZEA and VK3VA</B></A>
built a node stack that interoperates between D-Star, IRLP and AllStar networks.

<P>
<B>AllStar Network Support:</B> WB6NIL, Jim Dixon, <B>WB6NIL</B> has jumped
on board with an <A HREF="aprstt.html"><B>APRStt</B></A> decoder in his 
<A HREF="https://allstarlink.org/about.html"><B>AllStar</B></A>
code that will identify his voice users to APRS and the Univeral Contact scheme when they
send their DTMF callsign.  He is now in the testing phase.  Zoom in on his activities in
California and see his DTMF tests near his local AllStar nodes.
<P>

<B>Mobile and HT User Interface:</B> For 5 decades, the universal mobile operator's human interface to 
networks has been the DTMF key pad.  But for now two-decades, the APRS mobile operator has
much greater flexibility in his abiilty to send and receive, capture and display text.
Part of this initiative is to make use of this greater flexibiilty in the Mobile User
Interface.  There are two directions here.  
<P>

<LI><B>APRS Touchtone, <A HREF="aprstt.html">APRStt</A>:</B> This allows all other hams to participate in the 
APRS system by initially allowing them to report their <B><i>PRESENCE</i></B> by sending
their pre-stored DTMF callsign on any existing DTMF system.

<P>
<LI><B>APRS Radio Terminal:</B>  This part of the initiative concerns modification of the
user interface of all the VOIP and other ham radio mobile network interfaces to allow the
APRS mobile radio to be used as the end-terminal-equipment with its text TX and Display
capabilities to set up the calls.  This is basically the foundation of
 <A HREF="avrs.html"><B>AVRS!</B></A>  
<P>

<B>SMS Gate: </B>  This
A HREF="http://smsgte.wix.com/smsgte"><B>SMS Gateway</A> for APRS messaging was developed by Paul Dufresne, VE3OTB.

Please help me keep this site updated with pointers to all the other projects working towards
this univeral connectivity goal.
