<P>

<B>2022 Plans:</B> The date is 16 July 2022 and with the last 3 years successes at 9600 baud,
  We will
begin at 9600 baud and with the  higher beacon rate from the end stations to quicken link
confirmation by a factor of ten over previoius years.  This year we are inviting someone to 
man up <B><I>Stone Mountain</B></I> outside of Atlanta to extend the link further south.

Long-term, we still want to continue our quest for a permanent 
<A HREF="ec9600net.html"><B>220 9600 baud backbone</B></A>. This year we are reaching out to
other packet networks along the Appalachian states to join existing efforts. Each node will have a 1200 baud
local user access. Please check the web page for the new ideas.    
Here is the <A HREF="hamtrails/2m-band-plan-ideas.png"><B>band plan</B></A>.

See the <A HREF="hamtrails/2020/2020-ATGP-plan-a.txt"><B>Beacon-rate Plan for 2020</B></A>.
<P>
<B>20 July 2019 Success!</B> See 2019 report above, but generally it was very successful with
Springer seeing Katahdyn, but Katahydn not getting the SPringer Packet though he got all others.
9600 baud was successful in minutes of switching over.  That and lessons learned suggest
a much more exciting plan for 2020 (see above).

working when an antenna was relocated at AOMTN-5 and a coax was replaced at SAMSPT-10.

<B>The GOLDEN PACKET Event is the 3rd Saturday in July:</B> For the last
30 years, Packet Radio just <i>ain't got no respect</i> at the national Field Day
events, so we do our own outdoors VHF packet radio field event! Also, that weekend is often the
<A HREF="http://www.cqww-vhf.com/">CQ Worldwide VHF contest</A> 
putting lots of Hams on the mountain tops.. as well as Scouting's
<A HREF="http://www.bsaontarget.org/"><B>Operation On-Target</B></A> events.  

 Most of Scouting's Operation On-Target efforts are out west.  But no reason we cannot use APRS along national mountain chains including the 
<A HREF="pct-golden-packet.html"><B>Pacific Coast Trail</B></A> above left.  
Or even the Continental Divide, or New Orleans to Chicago, or Texas to the Dekato's
or Lewis and Clark's National trail.  Utah and Idaho are big players in the ON-TARGET 
exercise. We need to get enough HamRadio internet-junkies out of their shacks.
<P>

To volunteer as a team leader for one of the other trails or Mountains and to get involved in the annual preparations, contact 
<i><B>WB4APR at amsat dot org</B></i> and join the YAHOO Group above.
<P>

<B>Goals:</B>   Our APRS Golden Packet event consists of APRS individuals on very high 
and widely separate peaks from Georgia to Maine or San Diego to Seattle or New Mexico to Montanna to attempt to relay  
text messages from hikers using hand-held radios the 2000 mile length of the 
Appalachain, Pacific Crest, Continental Divide or other long National mountain trails.  
Of course, this is to be a no impact 
<A HREF="http://www.lnt.org"><B>Leave-No-Trace</B></A> communications test of a few 
individuals at each relay point to support possible other hikers equipped with APRS 
ham radios  along the trail.   APRS normally does not do long haul RF, 
due to the omni-directional flooding of packets which causes QRM.  But for LINEAR trails,
there are NO <i> dupes</i> to worry about, and long haul along a trail is a great demo
of emergency point-to-point communications.
<P>

<B>East Coast Event:</B>  This particular page is for the Appalachian Mountains event.  As before, we hope that other groups along other long
linear trails in the USA will get involved in their areas such as the
  <P>

<A HREF="2016-reports.html"><B>2016 Success with 9600 baud (16 July 2016):</B></A> 
Despite the hornet stings, blownout tire, abandoned vehicle, forgotten date, blown radio, hot weather, and old Age, the Annual Appalachian Trail Golden Packet Event was mostly a success and it was the first time we switched to 9600 baud and found performance unaffected by the data speed.  Intermod and interference on mountain tops remains a problem at some sites, and LOTS of details will be filled in by folloup reports on this page.  

<P>
The link was broken at MtWash-13 (wrong date) leaving 14 and 15 isolated and
at Clingmans-2 (blown-out radio) leaving Springer-1 isolated. Until SAMSPT-10 came 
on line, a new location, SLIDE-10 at twice the altitude (4100') provided links direct to EQUINOX-12 bypassing GREYLOCK-13 and its high levels of RFI.  If this is viable, next year we can eliminate one hop in the chain! 
See the 
<A HREF="hamtrails/Slide/Slide-paths.png"><B> paths from SLIDE-10</B></A>.
<P>

<A HREF="ec9600net.html"><B>2016 First 9600 Baud Test:</B></A> After the switch to 9600 baud at 1300, 
all stations reported success from North Carolina to PA and NY to Vermont with solid links.  
This opens up exciting possibilities for a permanent Eastcoast emergency packet backbone using level-4 (link-by-link) acknowledgement links.  
Some digipeating anomolies were confusing at CAMELBACK-9 and at COMERS-4 both using D700's (I think).

<B>2015 A partial success:</B> The event was 18 July 2015 and all stations were manned.  
But the brand new last minute volunteer for Sam's point was not yet packet capable so
he was doing voice relay.  Sufficient to get the "word" end to end, but a nice
challenge then for next year (2016).  Sam's point is a place that has to be hiked up several hundred feet 
and significant distance from the nearest parking lot.  So making it small and lightweight is a challenge.  
An additional challenge is that the top of Sam's Point is very flat, meaning the link to the Northeast has very little HAAT in that
direction.
And being near commercial sites, the front end overload and intermod is severe.

<P>

<B>2014 SUCCESS 100%</B> We did it!  On 19 July 2014, this 6th annual attempt, the teams 
<A HREF="hamtrails/manning2014.txt"><B>(see manning list)</B></A>

succeeded in end-to-end data packets from Georgia to Maine and back!  Normally the annual date is the 3rd Saturday in July. 
<B><i>BUT due to the ARRL convention in the Northeast on that date, we shifted to Sunday, the 20th.</i></B>  The 19th was also the
<A HREF="http://www.cqww-vhf.com/">CQ Worldwide VHF contest</A>.
The APRS image
showing all the stations as captured by AL0I in NC is shown above right.  After the Golden Packets were
successful at about 12:45, multiple messages were exchanged along the link.  The detail reports from each
station are detalied on the individual mountain-top pages below. It will 
take a while to clean up all the logs, but here is the 
<A HREF="hamtrails/Packets-2014-g.txt"><B>initial data log</B></A>
 captured at the midpoint.  The file shows the source and final-heard station for each packet.
There are still many more log files to go over, so this is a work in progress.  In addition, 
a full report of the event will hopefully be published in QST and on this site as the reports come in. (ARRL declined as <i>"it was not of general ham interest"</i>).
<P>


<B>Operation On Target 2014:</B> Bring a mirror.  Although we have seen ZERO Boy Scout interest in the east
for Operation On-Target, there is no reason we should not do this ourselves for them.  We cannot
hit peak-to-peak from GOlden Packet-to-golden packet station, but we can send our backup operators to surrouding peaks with a pocket mirror and simply start checking off all the peaks we CAN flash.  Besides while you are sitting up there on your peak with nothing to do, waiting for all the rest  of us to debug our sites, you may as well play with something!
<P>

<B>Permanent sites?</B> Given the success of the links, it might be a great idea to consider if
a permanent site can be secured to make this link long term viable.  In that case, we have established 
<A HREF="kpc3/kpc3-for-AT.txt"><B>settings for the KPC3</B></A> TNC for best operation.

<B>2013 Report:</B> 20 July 2013 we had all 15 mountain peaks manned
including Canadians on Mt Carrelton in New Brunswick. 
See the <A HREF="2013-reports.html"><B> 2013 Reports</B></A>.
This year Mt Equinox replaced the NH Relay location. The Northeast had some bad
weather with Tim getting drenched up on Katahdyn.   Very quickly most of
the Northeast could all see packets from Sams Point (10) to Katahdyn.  And similarly
down South, most stations could see each other except for Springer Mtn which was also
impacted by rain and only got out one packet.  Clingman's also had heavy rain.
Camelback seemed to have a deaf receiver and never
heard anything, breaking the chain.  Maryland Mountain had the common deaf-receiver problem
until the bands were swapped.  AO Mountain seemed to have relayed very few packets too, 
revealing a problem with Receiving, since its packets were well received elsewhere.  

<P> 

<B>Golden Packet and Operation ON-Target combined:</B>. Each year the Golden Packet (APRS)
 event coincides with Scouting's
<A HREF="http://www.bsaontarget.org/"><B>OPERATION ON TARGET</B></A> event.
On-Target is an annual Ham / Scouting event using MIRRORS and HAM radio to communicate from mountain top to mountain top.  Out west there are may dozens of active troops doing OT, but are just beginning to apply APRS to their event, and conversly, back east we do the APRS Golden Packet from the Mountain tops but no scouts playing with the mirrors.  Lets try to help Eastern Scouts participate!

<P>

<B>PURPOSE:</B>  To find suitable, easy-to-reach sites which can be activated easily
for potential backup emergency communications links across the USA.  Amateur Radio
has long been known to provide backup communications capability to public service
agencies when needed.  We will
demonstrate our ability to communicate 
<A HREF="aprs-messaging.html"><B>positions and messages</B></A>
 along the length of the Appalachians or Pacific Mountains.
Normally considered a 2000 mile hike, the Appalachian RF path is on the order of only 1200
miles and we hope to do this in only 14 hops.  But additional 
<A HREF="hamtrails/secondary.html"><B>Secondary Link Stations</B></A> can also
participate after the initial end-to-end tests are successful.

<P>
<IMG SRC="hamtrails/Springer-plaque.JPG" height=180 width=240 align=right>

<B>OPERATING SCHEDULE:</B>  The Operation ON-TARGET event lasts from 1100 to 1400 LOCAL TIME and the CQ contest begins at 1800z (also 1400 EDT) so plan accordingly.  For the Appalachian attempt, this means we have from 11 AM to 2 PM to get our packets working.
  Here is a typical plan for the Appalachian Trail Golden Packet experiment is (other mountain chains are welcome to make their own schedules):
<P>

<LI> 0800 to 1000 Set up (coordinate on your PUBLISHED local repeater, and APRS on 144.39, and ANSRVR)
<LI> 1000 to 1100 Station checkouts (voice with adjacent nodes on 445.925 (no tone), messages via HOP2-2 or so)
<LI> 1100 to 1300 Golden packet attempts on 144.34 MHz from both ends only (using HOP7-7,HOP7-7 paths)
<LI> 1300 to 1400 DIGIPEATER Site-to-site messaging only (using HOP7-7,HOP7-7 paths) on <B>144.34</B>
<LI> 1400 to 1500 All other TRAIL hikers and DIGIPEATER stations (CQ contest begins)
<LI> 1500 to 1600 Any other APRS or packet stations in range
<LI> 1600 to 2000 Tear down and go home (Cease operations on 144.34).

<P>
<IMG SRC="hamtrails/AT-event-RF.JPG" height=300 width =230 align=right>
<P>

<B> Permissions!:</B> <i>This is not a park event!</i> All park and trail authorities have <i> <B>special event</B> 
application fees </i> as much as $100 each, so it must be very clear to even the 
casual observer that this is <B>NOT</B> a <i><B> park event</B> </i>.
Although ham radio operators have traditionally used
the term <i> event</i> to describe a <i> convergence of activity
<B> on-the-air</B></i>, this is not a <i>park </i>event.  
That is why we have a designated leader at each site to organize
any participation without triggering park concern.  For 2009 on the AT we luckally
got the OK of the ATC Ranger but had to do a lot of
<A HREF="hamtrails/AT-permission.txt"><B> explaining</B></A> to insure the 
low impact of our plans.  One team  made the mistake 
of trying to get an <i>event</i> approval and nearly got denied access to the park.
See our <A HREF="hamtrails/roan-letter.txt"><B>attempted letter</B></A> to try to
recover.  There is no law or rule against operating an Amateur Radio
mobile in a park, just follow all existing rules and remain <B><i>no-impact</i></B> and
<A HREF="http://www.lnt.org"><B>LEAVE-NO-TRACE:</B></A>
Stay well below the threshold
that would trigger concern by any National, State, or local park authority and
require copious red-tape.  


<P>
<B>VOLUNTEERS: </B> We need volunteers for the planned peaks, 
plus any hikers that want to participate.  Due to the criticality of
each site to the whole event, it is a requirement to have backup people,
and hardware.  Also, an extra person to answer any questions of any bystanders.
Since few scouts do On Target back east, once everythig is working, you can send
yoru extra folks with pocket mirrors to other visible peaks and try to make
some mirror  contacts for the scouts. 
Details for each site  are in the links below. 
Most day hikers are really into GPS, so why not APRS too? . 
To sign up as a volunteer, please contact <i>wb4apr at amsat dot org</i> or
better, contact the individuals and team leaders for each team on each of the
station web pages below.  Due to the height of these stations, probably half of all
east cost hams can monitor the test in the shaded yellow area shown at right.
<P>

<P>
<B>APRS BACKGROUND: </B> Although the Global APRS network provides full coverage along the
Appalachians on the USA APRS channel of 144.39 MHz, it is linked globally via
the internet and so it is impossible to demonstrate long distance communications on RF only.
 Plus it is RF saturated. Long haul RF
communications is not possible nor encouraged due to congestion.  . Therefore, this
test will use a special uncongested frequency (144.34) just for this one day.
Using amateur radio from mountian peaks is part of the 
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/peak2peak.yahoogroups.com"><B>peak2peak</B></A> and
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/sota.uk"><B>SOTA</B></A> projects, but to reduce the risk of RF
congestion, this test is planned to avoid any VHF contest weekend.
<P>

<P>
<B>SIGNIFICANT APRS CHARACTERISTICS FOR THIS TEST:</B>

<LI> 1) Trail stations will use the short path HOP7-7,HOP7-7 for all traffic
<LI> 2) Trail stations may use the <i>traceable</i> TEMPn-N for short tests
<LI> 3) Stations should be able to see all adjacent nodes in both directions
<LI> 4) Being linear links, there will be few dupes and little QRM.  
<LI> 5) D700/710 or D72's are required for consistent TEMPn-N and HOPn-N digi's.

<P>
The reason for the radio specific requirement is due to the elimination of 
ALL potential set-up, configuration, and interfacing issues.  See below.

<P>
<B>STATION AND ROUTE PLANNING:</B>  For maximum range between hops, the best path for all
trails from Georgia to Maine or San Diego to Seattle, ZIG/ZAGs as shown on the
above maps rather than trying 
to shoot straight along the ridge.  The height-above-average-terrain between the
peaks along the trail ridge is significanly less than across valleys and drastically
limits line of sight distances. . But zig/zagging from the 
peaks to adjacent mountain ranges and back across valleys, takes 
advantage of <i>thousands</i> of feet difference in heights above
average terrain and allows us to make much greater distances in fewer hops.
<P>

<B>SOUTHERN HALF OF THE APPALACHIANS ON GOOGLE EARTH.  SEE BELOW:</B>
<P>

Using this Google Earth Technique, we nailed down Apple
Orchard Mountain along the Blue Ridge Parkway with excellent views both north and
south as a solid location due to its popularity with VHF Contesters.  Also it has
three FM repeaters  on 146.685, 442.65, 443.3 MHz with PL 100 making path testing easy.
From there we explored all options north and south.
the view below shows all the possible routes from Springer Mountain in Georgia
to Apple Orchard Mountain through the southern Appalachians.

We had looked at trying to make a 2 hop path from Clingman's to Apple Orchard via Rogers
Mountain, (see <A HREF="hamtrails/Clingmans%20NorthX.JPG"><B>path</B></A>) 
but it was very marginal and Mount Rogers is all tree covered with no drive-up
access.  The adjacent 
<A HREF="hamtrails/Whitetop.txt"><B>Whitetop Mountain</B></A> has good access and 
is popular with VHF contesters but is blocked to AO by Mount Rogers.
The best path zig's across the I-81 valley to
White Rock Cliff on Little Sluce Mountain on the Virginia and West Virginia line
 and then on to the Maryland mountains.  These links all the way to Mount Katahdin
are listed below.

<B>EASTERN PATH ALTERNATE:</B>  From Georgia, we found a possible 4 hop path around to 
the east starting with 
a 68 mile path from Springer Mountain to Whiteside Mountain in North Carolina, then
on to Sugarloaf, and to Pilot Mountain and on to AO as shown below.  But we never got any
volunteers along this route.  <A HREF="hamtrails/Springer-options.jpg"><b>(see route)</B></A>

<P>
But again, we do not know if those peaks are accessible?  But we could activate this alternate
path as well and
simply include a DWAIT on the eastern path.  This would slightly delay those packets and
avoid any collisions with the other I-81 path.  And it could double our reliability!
<P>


<IMG SRC="hamtrails/WA5DJJx.JPG" align=right>


<B>STATION CALLSIGNS-SSID's:</B>  Since there are 15 stations, we used
the 15 SSID's in sequence for the convenience of knowing the
relationships between sites along the way.  Specific callsigns have been
assigned so that messaging can occur in the blind.  Please see the
<A HREF="hamtrails/golden-checklist.txt"><B>callsign list</B></A>.  
The sequence is South to North
which is the usual direction of through-hikers who begin the treck in the spring
in Georgia and hope to end by the Fall in Maine.
<P>

<B>STATION TEXT: </B> Initially, each station sets  his position text to
include his FCC call 
and his estimated event-end-time.  Something like
<i>WB4APR till 1400EDT</i> (meaning 1400 Eastern Daylight Time). 
But as he begins to see other stations, 
he can show what he is seeing by including their X# in his text.  
Example:  WB4APR till 1400 QSL:12345689ABC which means WB4APR can see other stations 
as far south as 1 and as far north as 12 ("C" in Hex) and all stations in between.

<P>
<B>FREQUENCY - Packet and UHF coordination:</B>  Finding a clear frequency for
the 4 hour event is a severe problem.  Since the duration of this event is
about the same as the duration of a Balloon flight, and just as exciting,
we asked the ATV Balloonests if we could operate on 144.34.  
For simplex voice coordination, the national APRS FM simplex channel of 
445.925 is used.  In
addition, parallel operation of a second APRS station on the national 
144.39 can also be used for end-to-end coordination.  The below diagrams show 
how a TM-D7 dual band APRS radio can serve
all functions of Digipeater, Text Messagingand Voice coordination.  While a
D7 HT can be used for the 144.39 normal APRS opertaion.
<P>

<IMG SRC="hamtrails/splitter.GIF">
<P>

<B>ECHOLINK/IRLP COORDINATION:</B>  Since this is a comms exercise, we should test our ability to establish voice communications with Echolink or IRLP voice links.
  Each site can call into a conference node set up for this
event.  To find the nearest EchoLink node
please see the <A HREF="http://www.echolink.org/links.jsp"><B>Echolink node finder</B></A>.
We can use this for 
end-to-end overall coordination from 11 AM to noon or onward.  Think of it!  End-to-end Voice,
end-to-end APRS messaging (on 144.39 via IGates) and hopefully end-to-end APRS on 
RF alone for the test. See these IRLP nodes along the trail 
<A HREF="hamtrails/IRLP-south.GIF"><B>IRLP Map South</B></A>, and
<A HREF="hamtrails/IRLP-north.GIF"><B>IRLP Map North</B></A>.

<P>
For the 2009 conference node, WB3GXW has offered his
<A HREF="http://www.artscipub.com/repeaters/comments.asp?rid=21947&amp;ln=WB3GXW-repeater-information-on-147.225-in-Silver-Spring,-Maryland">
<B>*WASHDC*</B> node, number 6154 </A> for this
test.  Just connect in at 11 AM and join in (AT Stations only).

<P>
<B>POSITION PACKET RATES:</B>  The standard APRS rate for Tactical Operations is
once per 10 minutes.  This gives good update latency 
while keeping background channel loading low.  
Each digi will hear two other digis direct, but will hear up to 14 other 
station position reports.  With these statistics the channel (as heard at each digi)
will be blocked for 3 seconds each or 45 seconds total in 10 minutes or about 8%. .
This is close to half of the channel ALOHA capacity and leaves plenty of room
for the messages.  Hopefully Mic-E format will be used for efficiency.

<P>
<B>MESSAGE PACKET RATES:</B>  The other half of ALOHA channel capacity is
for message packets.  Using the above logic, Stations should not average a
higher message rate than once every 10 minutes if all 15 stations are
operational.
During set-up and throughout the test, end-to-end APRS coordination is easy
on 144.39 either normal operation or via the ANSRVR with messages
to CQ AT CQ AT. (<A HREF="cqsrvr.html"><B>see ANSRVR</B></A>).
<P>
<IMG SRC="hamtrails/AT-digi-config.JPG">
<P>

<B>DIGIPEATER BATTERY POWER:</B>
The Mountain top Digipeaters consist of a D700/D710, 
a mast as required to clear the trees, and a power source.
The mimimum test is 3 hours long, but the optional phases can last up to a total
of 5 hours, so ample AMP-Hr capacity should be considered.  The D700/710 draws about .7 amps
on receive and about say 4.5 amps on TX (medium power 10W).  
Under normal operation, the APRS ALOHA channel can support up to about
 20% load so the average digipeater power demand
will be about .2 * 4.5A +.7A or about 1.6 Amps per hour. A good plan might one 7 AH battery
for the event, or two 4 AH batteries, replacing one toward the end as it dies gives a good indication
of battry life remaining (the spare).
We have found enough clouds or rain every year to make it too risky to depend on
solar power. (a 1 Amp-Hr battery and a 1.5 amp solar panel as shown). 

<P>
We are requesting that only D710 radios be used as the digipeater, 
since they can be reconfigured in the field from the front panel menus.  D700's have to be set (and checked) using a PC on the serial port significanly complicating troubleshooting.  Using only the D710's with their built-in modems eliminates all the very common interfacing issues we hear on the air every day...  Listening to packets on the air, MOST have poor audio, tone, levels,
tone inbalance unknown pre-and-de emphasis and
deviation settings adding up to 20 dB or more in performance loss.  We can eliminate 
these variables by just using D700's that at least were all set for optimum at the
factory, and provide reliable packet operation down to a very good 0.3 uV (-117 dBm).
<P>

<B>DIGI SETTINGS:</B> Each digi along The trail will be set to
support traceable TEMPn-N packets and the shorter non-traceable HOPn-N
path.  The two settings are:  "UITRACE TEMP" and "UIFLOOD HOP,ID".  Then saving these to a PM memory makes operations at thge mountain top quick and easy.  Setting the TEMPn-N support can
actually remain there forever since we want all D700/710's always to be able to 
at least support the come-as-you-are  
<A HREF="TEMPn-N.html"><B>TEMPn-N</B></A> backup system.  All D700/710's 
are supposed to be configured with the TEMPn-N support by default for emergency
backup communications at any time.  
TEMPn-N is great for omni-directional temporary communications for
special events like Field Day.  Here we cannot afford the bulk, however, of the
long trace packets using TEMPn-N, so we are using the UIFLOOD HOP7-7 which should only ID
the last digi in each packet.

<P>

<B>PACKET PATHS:  </B>All packets will use the HOP7-7,HOP7-7 path so that
packets will go the 14 hop length of the trail.  Using this non-traceable path
keeps the packets short.  But to resolve any anomolies, the Traceable TEMPn-N paths 
are also possible for short tests, but these packets grow by 7 bytes at each hop 
and should be avoided
most of the time.  No one knows what will happen beyond that.
 
<P>
<B>MESSAGE FORMATS:</B>  For the official long haul Golden Packets that you want
everyone to see, use 
only BULLETINS (BLN#xxxxx).  This eliminates ACKS and QRM, yet lets everyone
read the mail.  To indicate a specific recepient, squeeze their identifier
into the available optional 5 bytes xxxxx, but otherwise the xxxxx is not needed.
Stations with D700's must read and <i>delete</i> incoming messages to make
sure to keep room for more incoming messages.  D710's can hold as many as 100
unread messages.  Keep a paper log if you are not using a
PC APRS as well.

<P>
<B>GOLDEN PACKET TRACING:</B> We only use HOPn-N paths instead of TEMPn-N paths. 
You can see how these packets would get very long, if TEMP7-7 Tracing was used.
The packet can only go 7 hops and would arrive as

SGRLOF-14,MTWASH-13,N1CNA-12,GRYLCK-11,SAMSPT-10,CMLBCK-9,GDHILL-8,TEMP7*</i>
<P>
But using HOP7-7,HOP7-7 it can go 14 hops and arrive simply as:
<i>MDMTN-7,HOP7,MAINE-14,HOP7*</i>.  This shows that it took 7 hops to
get to Maryland Mountains and then 7 more hops to the MAINE RELAY site.

<P>
<B>DUAL SYSTEMS:</B> Each participating digipeater site station
should operate with two APRS stations.

<P>
<LI> Use the main high power station (D700/D710) as the digipeater. It can also
be used for MESSAGES via HOP7-7,HOP7-7. 

<LI> Use an HT or other APRS station on 144.39 for all other information
and chatter either normally or via the ANSRVR.
<P>


<P>
<B>2-WAY IGATES PROHIBITED!</B> It would be a disaster if someone brought up a 2-way IGate on 
the test frequency.  But, on the other hand, having a SINGLE monitor-<b>only</B> Igate
at each end and in the middle might let the world watch-in.  But again, this is playing
with fire, and a missconfigured IGate could spoil the entire event.
<P>

<B>HARPERS FERRY and TRAIL CONFERENCE DEMO:</B> Another possible volunteer need would be to set up 
a Ham Radio demo table near the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters
in Harpers Ferry on the test day to demonstrate the event and 
another possible demo at the at the 
<A HREF="http://www.vermont2009.org/"><B>Biennial Appalachian Trail Festivals</B></A>
to promote Amateur
Radio to the assembled thousands of hikers attending the festrival.
  Other low-key demonstration stations at public areas along the AT are also be welcome.

<P>
