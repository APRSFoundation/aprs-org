The self plotting of APRS packets and global connectivity of
the APRS-Internet System (APRS-IS) makes it ideal 
for casual Meteor Scatter communications experiments.  This page suggests
four ideas for experiments with Meteor Scatter comunications:
<P>
<LI> For Fun, monitor 144.39 in rural areas for meteor packets 
<LI> See great results of some early experiments in 1998 and 1999 below...
<LI> Add 6m FM receivers to scattered IGates to capture emergency
     APRS emails/messages out of a disaster area.
<LI> Prepare for hammering messages back into an affected area's D7/D700's 
using 9600 baud MS on 2m.
<LI> See <A HREF="APRS-docs/METEOR.TXT">METEOR.TXT</A> for details

<B>Monitoring APRS for Meteor Packets:</B> .  Anyone in a relatively rural area
can easily just monitor APRS any night, and especially during meteor
showers to see what kind of packets can be heard.  APRS has the advantage of dozens
of packets beging transmitted every second from all over the USA on the same 
frequency.  Any of these are potential Meteor bounce packets, but only if the
listener is in a quiet location.  But this is quite possible in most non-city
areas.  Before we get into the details of how to monitor for Meteors on 144.39 
in the USA, first some facts:
<P>
<LI> The biggest interference to reception is the local digipeater
<LI> 95% of the packets from any digipeater are coming from out-of-area.
<LI> The New-N paradigm has reduced the number of dupes by a factor of 2 to 3 or more
<LI> The primary mission of APRS in most areas is LOCAL communications.

<P>
<B>Monitoring Meteor Packets:</B> . You must use a beam.
<P>
If you live in a quiet area, where your digi is only busy say 20% of the time, then
your station can still hear possible meteor packets for 80% of the time!  Just point
your beam towards a HIGH density APRS area between 500 to 1000 miles away.  Clear your
APRS memories and buffers and go to sleep.  Next morning see what you got?
<P>
<B>Meteor Shower Special Events:</B> . Since meteor showers only last one night and are very predictable,
it is easy to further improve your chances of hearing packets by asking the local 
DIGI sysop to change the settings for one night.  These "meteor-event" digi settings
will still allow local digipeating of all packets and all visitors, but will reduce
the number of packets coming in from out of area.  This way, APRS continues to perform
locally, but the amount of channel loading goes down by a factor of TEN or more!
<P>
For the night of a meteor shower, (Persides, Leonids, or Geminids, (August, November and December),
simply ask the local DIGI sysop to change UITRACE from "WIDE" to OFF and make sure
that the UIDIGI LIST contains WIDE1-1, WIDE2-1, WIDE2-2, and WIDE3-3.  This will quiet
the channel drastically in rural areas.  Point your beam, and see what you capture
by the next morning.  It might also be useful to post an APRS bulletin the week in advance
on the local channel announcing
something like "APRS digipeating reduced to local hops only on 12 August"...
<P>
<B>Meteor Shower Results in 1995</B> 
<P>
The rest of this page is historical.  APRSdos has a fully automatic Meteor scatter communications
mode, but it was not implemented by any other authors that I konw of.  It is not
appropriate to use the special MeteorScatter mode on 144.39 but only on dedicaed
frequenceis such as 147.585 maybe, if agreed in advance.  This is why meteor packet
capture on 144.39 as  described above has been developed to make it more routine
and where all the action already is.

<P>
During the 1998 Leonids we saw good APRS packet meteor scatter propogation.  
Please read <A HREF=""APRS-docs/METEOR.TXT">METEOR.TXT</A> which tells you all about using APRS 
or just a TNC for MScatter.  The map below shows the results of the 
1995 Perseids Meteor Scatter APRS tests.
