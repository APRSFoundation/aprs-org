<B>Amateur Radio Field-Day at Annapolis City Dock was an outstanding success.  Our FD score was
inversely proportional to our high score in talking to the public as we
met with many boaters and interested kids and adults taking literature
to find clubs and information.  Boaters were particularly interested in HF.  Field Day
is an annual National event where Ham radio operators throughout the USA
 set up communications in the field under simulated emergency conditions.

The original <A HREF="fd/CityDock-planA.JPG"><B>Plan A</B></A>, 
had the tent closer to Market place, but 
<A HREF="fd/CityDock-planA2.JPG"><B>plan A2</B></A> consolidated the tent and trailer. 
<A HREF="fd/CityDock-planB2.JPG"><B>Plan B2</B></A> was on the point
but parking on the bricks was not allowed.
<B>Plan D </B> shown below, put us in the parking lot ($50 per space for the weekend) and
close to slip #14 necessary to hold AA3MW's 14' wide boat:

<B>Plans for 2009!</B> Next Year we want to encourage more operators to come on down
with their man-portable gear and operate within the 1000' radius that constitutes
a field day limit. Dozens of small sites have been located where individual
operators can set up their man-portable COMMS equipment and show the public
as they walk by on the sidewalk.  Or pay to park and operate from the vehicle.
