<B>RAFT MISSION IS COMPLETE:</B> RAFT de-orbited on 30 May 2007 after 5 months in space.
The mission for RAFT was successful and in the last week, we finally got the Radar Fence
Transponder Data we had been hoping to get.  Please see the

<B>PRE-LAUNCH INTEGRATION:</B>  Launched 10 December 2006 on Shuttle STS-116 and deployed in the first 2 hours of 21 Dec 2006.  
Delivered 25 Jan 2006 to JSC Houston for vibration testing. Then
17 July 2006 to Kennedy Space Center for Integration with the Shuttle.  
Photo above was delivery from USNA and testing the separation system
in a Zero-G flight with NASA.  The pre-launch debate was the deployment altitude 
to safely avoid re-contact with ISS.  The plot below shows how our original altitude ot 180
has been reduced to 175, and by launch time 165 nautical miles was being considered 
which would shorten the life to only 2 months or less:

<B>CUBESATS:</B>  Cubesats are a Stanford University program initiated by Dr.
Bob Twiggs to provide low cost satellite launches for student 
experiments.  Those cubesats are all 4" in size and are launched 3 at a time
from simple standard launchers called P-PODS.  As many as a dozen or more may
be launched on a single launch vehicle.
<A HREF="http://ssdl.stanford.edu/cubesat/"> Link to Stanford CUBESATS </A> or see DOD's
<A HREF="http://www.skyrocket.de/space/doc_sdat/mepsi.htm"><B> MEPSI</B></A>, and 
<A HREF="http://www.darpa.mil/mto/mems/summaries/Projects/Aerospace_1.html"> Others</A>.

<P>
<B>DOD Interest:</B> The DOD interest in this RAFT project is its requirement to 
TRACK all space
objects and the difficulty it will have in tracking these 4" cubesat clusters due to
their large numbers and small size which is below the NSSS routine tracking ability.
RAFT was approved by the DOD Space Experiments Review Board in the fall of 2002.
Since DOD cannot pay for our project to fly on the typical Cubesat Russian 
(low cost) launcher, DOD developed their own 5" cubesat launcher.
<P>
<IMG SRC="craft/RAFT-NMARS.JPG" align="left" >

<P>
<B> RAFT OBJECTIVES: </B>
The RAFT Mission is to provide a cubesat in the cubesat cluster 
which has an
on-board receiver capable of identifying itself via the NSS satellite Radar 
Tracking system to help locate the Cubesats.  Without this receiver, the Cubesats
are too small to be detected by normal non-queued tracking systems, and so there is no 
easy way to find these individual cubesats once they have begun to spread from the 
original launch tracking elements.  

<P>
<B> TWO RAFT's:</B>  The requirement for two cubesats to mark the initial front and 
back of the spreading constellation, also gives us two opportunities for experimental 
communications payloads.  We looked at several 
<A HREF="cubesat.html"> low power communications experiment possibilities </A> and
arrived at two designs.  One is called <B>RAFT</B> and the other is called <B>MARScom</B>.
<i>This</i> page describes common characteristics and RAFT itself.  For unique detail info on each one, see

<B>PACKET RELAY SECONDARY MISSION:</B> The secondary mission of RAFT and MARScom
are to provide packet digital communications relay for mobile amateur radio users to transmit
their GPS coordinates and messages via the satellites.  This is a continuation of
the PCsat, PCSAT2 and ARISS missions.  The downlink is received by a global system of
volunteer ground stations that feed a 
<A HREF="http://www.ariss.net"><B>live web page</B></A>.

<P>
<B>PACKET ==> VOICE COMMS RELAY SECONDARY MISSION:</B>  The primary limitation
on single channel LEO satellite communications is the congestion on the uplink.
The RAFT Packet ==> Voice transponder solves this problem by compressing the
uplink into a single 1 second burst per station, and then expanding it to voice
for the FM downlink.  This way, students with nothing but a scanner receiver can
hear all of the downlink communications (voice) yet the uplinking stations have
a very low probabilty of collision due to the short duration of the uplink.  A
voice synthesizer converts the packet to voice.

<B><U>RAFT PSK-31 MULTI-USER DIGITAL TRANSPONDER</B></U>
<P>
This transponder solves the primary problem of many amateur satellites and that is
the contention on the single channel uplink.  By using PSK-31, as many as 30 simultaneous
users can be supported in keyboard-to-keyboard communications as shown below.  Each
channel is only about 60 Hz wide.  This image shows the interference potential 
however, whenever the RAFT telemetry packet is transmitted.  Users should therefore
attempt to use the upper and lower ends of the spectrum.
<P>

<P>
<B>PRIMARY SPACE TRACKING MISSION:</B>
One RAFT will have a receiver for the NAVSPASUR radar system
as shown in the block diagram above. 
<A HREF="craft/XP217board.JPG"><B>(see photo)</B></A>.   When it flies through the fence,
it's direct-conversion double sideband receiver will mix the Doppler to baseband audio
which will be added to the RAFT1's downlink audio for detection on the ground. 
 A team
consisting of Boston area AMSAT members (Tony Monterio, AA2TX, Dave
Goncalves, W1EUJ, and Joe Fitzgerald, KM1P) are working on this NSSS
part of the project.
  <a href="http://www1.coe.neu.edu/~dpg/rx217.html"><b>See Their WEB
page</b></a>. 
For telemetry, command and control, the
RAFT's communications payload has an FM downlink suitable for this purpose.
Independently,  the 217 MHz receiver local oscillator is strong 
enough so that it can then also be heard
by the NSSS radar receiver on the ground as a separate means of verification.
<P>
The following links have information on the NSSS RADAR FENCE (it used to be called NAVSPASUR)
 that spans all of 
the southern states in the USA.  But this information has been gathered by non-DOD
tech-ies and neither the DOD nor the naval Academy is responsible for its content.

<BR>Use any satellite tracking program to predict when an object will pass through the fence.
Just enter the coordinates of the main Kickapoo Transmitter (33.558N  98.737W) and watch
for the instant your object crosses the azimuths of 91.4 and 271.4 degrees from Kickapoo.
<P>
Because of the extremely high power of this VHF radar (over 700kW), it can be received 
by just about
anyone with a handheld scanner receiver and an antenna pointed to the area in space
where any spacecraft passes through the "fence".  The radar is a pure carrier
radiating upward 24 hours a day in a very narrow FAN beam as shown in the MAP above.
Whenever a large spacecraft flies through that beam,  you should be able to hear
a "ping" on your SSB scanner at that frequency.

The above plot is the output from my SPASUR.EXE program for ISS intercepts viewed from
Atlanta.  It shows the elevation angle of the ISS when it passes through the
fence and the elevation angle from NAVSPASUR.  The yellow line shows the relative
signal strength relative to the best possible path geometry and location near
the transmitter site (Someone that lives 250 miles from the Texas transmitter site).  You may

<P>
<B> Preliminary NSSS Verification Test:</B> To give the students some familiarity
with the operation of the Radar Fence, on 21 April 2004, we set up a dipole with
reflector and detected the NSSS reflections from the Moon.  The moon passes 
through the fence twice a day for about 2 weeks of every month.  The pass lasts
about a minute per pass.  We recorded the event with DIGIPAN.  See the

<P>
<B>ANTENNA DEPLOYMENT DESIGN:</B>
<P>
Each of the two RAFT satellites have three antennas, one for HF, VHF and UHF.  
The VHF and UHF antennas are spring loaded and collapse
within the other satellite to the 5" available, but extend to the required length 
on separation.  Both antennas on each spacecraft are 10.75" long to provide
equal spring separation pressure, but are individually tuned with an LC network
designed by Tony.  All of these
antennas make no contact with the PLA-2 Launcher, but are mutually held in place by
each other.  On separation, their inertia will unpool their individual 4 foot long
HF wire antennas, lightly held together by a tiny tip magnet.

<P>
<B>LIFETIME:</B> Unfortunately, the RAFT satellites will be deployed after the Space Shuttle
leaves the Space station on its way back to Earth.  Because the primary mission of STS-116
is to deliver massive cargo to ISS, the ISS will be brought down to 205 miles for rendesvous
with the Shuttle.  Then, after departing the station, the current deployment altitude for
RAFT is expected to be only 185 miles which is quite low.  Mission life for RAFT1 is
estimated as 6.5 months
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/craft/RAFTlife.gif"><B>See plot</B></A> and for MARScom as 5 Months
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/craft/MARSlife.gif"><B>See plot</B></A>.
<P>
<B>Power System:</B>
<P>
One problem with pico sized satellites is the requirement to have enough series connected
solar cells on each panel to add up to a useable bus voltage.  On RAFT this problem is 
solved by using our innexpensive 8 volt panels to parallel charge two sets of batteries
during normal receive operations and then stacking the batteries in series when the 
transmitter is keyed.

<LI><A HREF="craft/RAFT8-12vPS.gif"><B>8/12 Volt Power System</B></A>

<P>
<B>Attitude Control:</B>
<P>
RAFT1 will use a permanent magnet to align itself with the earths magnetic field.
This allows its attitude to be predictible.  The plot below shows the alignment
of the RAFT1 antennas during West passes over the Naval Academy.
<P>
<IMG SRC="craft/MAG40w.gif">
<P>
To the north the antennas always appear vertical.  Low on the horizon to the south
they are nearly horizontal with the null pointed towards us.  We did this for
several directions and for different latitudes
<A HREF="attitudes.html"><B> (see Plots)</B></A>
<P>
An early idea was to hve a long HF wire antenna with a tip mass to provide
a gravity gradient stabilization as shown below.  But this was 
rejected because it would present a large cross section and increased drag to 
significantly shorten the mission life time.
