<P><B>Magentic Stabilization:</B> Many small amateur satellites have been flown with
magnetic stabilization.  For example, AO16, DO17, WO18, LO9, PCSAT, ECHO and RAFT and
others.  
These satellites have an internal bar magnet that aligns with the Earth's magnetic field
to insure they are always in a known attitude with respect to ground stations and also
experience a changing attitude with respect to the Sun on every orbit.  This helps
to limit thermal effects from the Sun from impinging too long on any one surface.
But more importantly for users on the ground, it impacts the apparent orientation
of the antennas on the spacecraft.  We can even demonstrate it in our Labs by
hanging on string:

<B>Earth's Magnetic Pole:</B> .  But first,
I just stole this image from the British Geological Survey site which shows where the
earths magentic pole is located.  The blue plot is the point where compasses generally
will point from other places on earth.  But the red plots of the <i>dip-pole</i>
are where the compass sees no horizontal component at all (I think?).

<B>Magentically Stabilized Satellites</B>
<P>
This web page was prepared to help the ground user visualize the satellites attitude
with respect to the geometry of passes in his location.  To produce these plots, I
simply added a vector to the display that I wrote for some of my tracking programs.
The vector is shown in the direction of the Earth's North Magnetic pole as it would
appear to the satellite observer looking in the given direction. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="labsats/MAGplots/MAG30w.gif">
<P>
The above plot shows how passes look in the Southern USA at 30 deg Latitude looking
West.  Notice how satellites to the south are quite horizontally polarized and the
closer to due south and lower, how the observer is usually in the null of the antenna.  But
this changes smoothly as the satellite moves north.
<P>
<IMG SRC="labsats/MAGplots/MAG40w.gif">
<P>

Notice how the problem to the South is not as great, but that clearly all
passes are vertical polarization when the satellite is nearer to the North.
<P>

<P>

At the Northern Latitude of 50 degrees North, the effect of the southern horizontal
alignment becomes less, but the problem of the satellites null pointing right at you
remains when the satellite is due south.  This effect is shown better in the following
southern views:
<P>

<IMG SRC="labsats/MAGplots/MAG50s.gif">
<P>

And to the North, everything remains Vertical or nearly so.

<B> SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE </B>
<P>
In the Southern Hemisphere, things will be upside down with respect to these plots.
The vector still points to the Earth's North magnetic pole, but this will appear
to be "up" instead of down as it was in the Northern Hemisphere.  The following plot
is the view to the East in the Southern Hemisphere.
<P>

<P>

<B>GRAVITY GRADIENT:</B>
<P>
And last, is a plot of a Gravity Gradient Stabilized satellite.  Until I plotted this,
I assumed there would be some small deviation from vertical depending on the direction
and distance to the satellite...  Sort of looking at it from a distant angle.  But
once I studied it, I realized that in any direction, the orientation of the antenna
towards the center of the Earth will have only a vertical component no matter where
on Earth you view it as shown below.  Typical Gravity Gradient Amateur Satellites 
have been UO-11, UO-14, Sunsat, SO-41, SO-50.
<P>
<IMG SRC="labsats/MAGplots/MAG50eGR.gif">
<P>

 Further, the higher the elevation angle 
when you view it, the further into the cone of the null of the antenna.  Thus
the projection you see above shows the vectors smaller, the higher they are in
elevation.  But this has less of an effect than may appear, because the satellite
is 6 to 10 dB closer when it is at those higher elevations.
<P>

<B>SAT-GATES:</B>
One of the reasons for this web page
is to help stations that are setting up FIXED antennas and adding their station's
heard packets to the global APRS internet linked ground stations.  These plots here
will show you where to expect your best data for a given orientation.   Examples 
of WEB pages that use the live data from these ground stations are
<A HREF="http://www.ariss.net"><B>ARISS</B></A> and
<A HREF="http://pcsat.aprs.org"><B> PCsat</B></A>.  But remember
it only applies to antennas on Magnetically or Gravity Gradient stabilized
spacecraft.
<P>

<B>FARADAY ROTATION:</B>
<P>
Faraday rotation will impact the actual polarity
of the signal arriving at the Earth station antenna.  The amount of rotation
is greater near the horizon and near the poles and the equator.  But it
is less by the square of frequency.  Hence, the effect is only one tenth
as much as 70cm as it is at 2 meters.  Even at 2 meters, for a quiet sun
the amount of rotation may only be a few degrees, though it can be as much
as 45 degrees or more with an active sun and low angles...
<P>

<B>DISCLAIMER:</B>  This web page is evolving and Does not yet have all the
satellites listed and my math for these projections may need further tweaking.
I developed a simple model of the Earths magnetic field with the North and South
magnetic poles being at the Earth's north and south geometric poles.  So it does
not account for the offset of the poles nor the up to 10 degree offset angle
of the poles.  Here are the relationships I am using and I welcome better
models:

<LI> Dip Angle of vector to local Horizontal proportional to SIN(MyLat - 2*Lss)
<LI> Horizontal projection of that vector proportional to SIN(AZ)
<LI> Vertical projection of that vector proportional to COS(EL)
<P>

Where AZ and EL are the local Azimuth and Elevation angles to the satellite, and
Lss is the latitude of the sub-satellite point.  MYlat is the Latitude of the
viewer.  Feedback welcome to bruninga(circle-at)usna.edu
<p>

<B>SATELLITE NOTES:</B> Note, you will not see the variation above on PCsat,
because none of PCsat's antennas are aligned with the magnetic vector although
the satllite is.  All of the antennas on PCsat are made of dual orthogonal
whips oriented at 45 degrees to the main magnetic axis.  Thus there is always one
or more that are broadside to the user, and no attitude can place the ground
user in a null.  Similarly most of the other PACSATS also have their UHF whips
in such a multi-whip cross polarized arrangement.  But their SINGLE VHF whip
is along the Spacecraft's magnetic vector and will see the attitudes above.
