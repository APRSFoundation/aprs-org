"APRS12" should show on the top of SIDE A

PRESS "BCON" button until BCON displays on the top line

PM - PROGRAM MEMORIES:  *** IMPORTANT***  Save in a PM! (IE PM#5)

1) Press [F] - PMin - Select PM number.  I use #5 to save it
2) But NOW you need to select PM5 to operate from.  Press PM - 5
3) NOW there is the all important new options in the AUX MENU
4) go to AUX and make two more settings:
   900 Set the NAME of your PM to AT-GP
   922 Set Auto-PM-store OFF !!! (might be MENU 521 in old radios)

NOW THEN DO ANOTHER [F] - PMin - 5 to SAVE this in PM5.

Power off the radio and back on and it should come up in PM5.
RE-SAVE the PM.

Operating from a PM and having AUTO-PM-STORE - OFF will assure that
nothing you will do will mess up PM 5 unless you purposfully make 
changes and then do another [F] - PMin - 5 SAVE.
