GD-Hill RF Test Report                                  20 June 2009
--------------------------------------------------------------------

My son WA4APR and I did an RF test from GD hill on 20 June to the
Maryland mountain site and Camelback site.

Summary:  

1) CQSRVR did not seem to work reliably for me?  

2) GD-Hill to Camelback link was 14 dB worse than prediction.

3) GD-Hill to MD Mtns was 9 dB better than prediction.

BASELINE:  All links on the AT web pages were computed with 2.1 dB 
vertical Dipoles and 10 watts.  My years of measurements with 
D7/D700's showed 100% success with "S5" on receipt.  So I used that 
as my benchmark.

Camelback to GD-Hill:

Predicted Camelback to GD HILL: 10 dB margin.
Measured with 50W and 9 el beam (+17dB added gains)
Gave 13 dB margin over S5
Conclusion: omni-to-omni would be - 4dB margin
So prediction was optimistic by 14 dB.
*** So either use a beam at camelback or run 50W at both ends

MD Mountains to GD Hill:

Predicted: + 17 dB margin
Measured with 5W (-3 dB added gains)
Gave solid packets with 23 dB margin.  *** rock solid!
Conclusion: omni-to-omni would be 26 dB margin
So prediction was pessimistic by 9 dB.

Camelback comments: Roger NJ2R and Jeff W2UA used a 9 el beam to GD 
Hill and had bad/wet weather.  Needed 35W on 445.925 to be S3 (very 
useable signal).  3W not heard on UHF.  KB3EJM, Kevin showed up as a 
local, and colunteered to do the event with ihs club which had already 
planned to be at Camelback on 26 July.

MD mountains:  Was WN3R's Winlink node on 145.77 which digipeated my 
GD-Hill D7 100% with 23 dB attenuation in the line...  Excellent link.

GD Hill is a great site. 66' observation tower is wonderful at the top 
with plenty of operating room.  Ladder climb is tight, so better to 
lift gear up each 7' vertical landing than backpacks.
