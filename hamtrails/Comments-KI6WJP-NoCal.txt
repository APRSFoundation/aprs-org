Hi Bob,

I have attached an updated copy of your map showing my 
proposed location.  This doesn't really fit with the "zig 
zag" approach, but it is right on the green line on your map.  

To the north, the Siskiyou mountains are potentially a 
problem. In doing some simple line of sight testing with 
google earth, it appears that there is a direct line of sight 
from Mount Eddy to "The Watchman" on the rim of Crater Lake 
113 miles to the north. Mount Vaca is direct line of sight 
202 miles to the south.  (both of these are "drive up" 
locations.)    I have posted some screen shots of both of 
these paths at http://sites.google.com/site/ki6wjp

I only mentioned Mt. Shasta because it is an obvious 
digipeater site (being 14162 feet high and 10000 feet above 
the average terrain.)  The climb is quite technical and I 
can't guarantee that a team could summit early enough and 
remain on the top for as long as required for the event.  It 
would be great to use this peak, but I don't think it is practical.

The only other possible peak in the area is Mt. Lassen which 
is 10000 feet.  However, the path to the north must cross 
some fairly high mountains to the east of Mt. Shasta.  Google 
earth testing shows that we don't have a direct line of sight 
to Crater Lake or other convenient drive up location in 
Oregon.  Mount Lassen is doable for my team, but is quite a 
bit farther drive.  (Mt Eddy is literally in my back yard.)

I'll spread the word to the local ham clubs to see if I can 
drum up some interest.  I can probably get some interested in 
a field trip to Crater Lake.  However, I'm one of the few 
that is into backpacking.
