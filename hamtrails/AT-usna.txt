LOG FILE RECORDED AT ANNAPOLIS MD                      26 Jul 09
----------------------------------------------------------------

This was from Hyperterm on a D700 in packet mode on a beam 
pointed from Annapolis Maryland to Maryland Mountains.  As you 
can see, it recorded what appears to be evey packet originated
at MD mountains...  THe beacons were at
1403, 05, 25,        probably initial connect up?
1431, 33, 34,        probably 1 minute rate test?
1448, 58             now into desired 10 minute rate
1500, 06, 10         not sure what is going on here
1511, 21             back to 10 minute rate
1523, 33, 43, 53, 03 good 10 minute rate
1616, 17, 22, 24
1631, 44

The PROBLEM is, that this log shows NO packets digipeated by MD 
Mountains at all.  They saw GD-Hill (which they could see direct) and
they also saw Camelback (which they -might- rarely see direct) and
they saw White Rock Cliffs, which they could see direct...  So 
we have no proof that they were digipeating if all we use are the
observed stations and this log.

Here are the oservations from Patrick at MD Mountains:

"I saw several packets from greylock around this time, 11:20 or 
11:30 till sometime after 12pm. I did see a few more till 4pm, 
but I think maybe only 2 or 3 packets.  SHut down at 4:05 or so"

Bob comment:  Interesting that this log shows nothing until 2:03
and then solid to 4 PM.  Nothing before that was heard?

Next report from Patrick:
"Hmm, I can't confirm it. But I do know it was digipeating, [because]
each time it heard a packet come it, it would go onair and transmit.
We also tested digipeating by using my mobile d700 to transmit 
packets  and made sure they where digipeated.

No idea why you station wouldn't show them, unless they got rejected  
by a dup filter.

The only other way I can confirm it was working was. When WV didn't  
have the correct settings, you where not seeing their packets, but  
once it was corrected, you could, cause I was then digipeating them."

And a later report:
"And your comment about the digipeating bug in the d700, I did 
notice this too. Whenever my station sent it's position, it would 
get digipeated, and it would digipeat itself again. I thought it odd 
at the time, but since I didn't have a good log of info, didn't try 
to figure out more. using the pmon isn't really good for figure that  
stuff out."

And:
"Every packet I looked at had GD Hill-8 in it for digipeated, so 
you where overpowering USNA if it was [colliding with USNA]."


So the mystery remains... why does not this log file contain
any packets from GD-hill or others...
