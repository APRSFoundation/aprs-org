<B>2014 SUCCESS!</B> NT1I reports: "We got to the top about 9:30 and were met with a heavy wind and light rain. The temperature was 45 degrees. I first lashed the painters pole to the bike hitch and then assembled the X300 dual band vertical antenna, connecting the ultraflex coax before mounting the antenna base to the pole and scooting it up as far as the wind would allow. I hooked the coax to the Kenwood d710 and the power to a lead acid automotive type battery.  By 10:05 we were waiting for voice contact on UHF.  We were also setup to do packet at the same time.  I went up to the top (we setup in the lower left parking lot) to use the facilities, and overheard WS1SM SOTA operation at the picnic table talking to MT EQUINOX on 146.52. So I finished my business and went back down. Geoff KB1POR had also heard Equinox on 2mtrs and made voice contact to EQUINOX while I was up top.
<P>
Geoff had a WiFi hotspot set up and I was using APRSISCE32 to send messages via the ANSRVR AT group over the WiFI.  But when the first packets from EQUINOX came through I had internet difficulties and couldn't send any messages.  I decided to fall back to taking pictures of teh packets but the Android device wouldn't function as a camera as the  sd card was missing!  Then we had cell phone contact with station 14 and soon after packets, and voice on uhf. Then we started seeing packets from GDHILL 8 show up.  I set up my pay as you go WiFi hot spot and was then able to post to the ANSRVR again So by 12:18PM we had 8, 11, 12, 14, 15 packets.
<P> 
I think you know the rest. we saw springer-1 Yep what a relief and it went all the way up to Maine..
<P>





<B>2013 Planning:</B> John Bates, NT1I is leading the effort this year.  Hopefully they
can stay far away from all the radio transmitters at the peak and better hear
the new Mt Equinox and Sugarloaf.  See the summary
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiYno6C9YkfGdHlkNHlVYUNyZEJ4S3RlTnNPZzREeFE#gid=0">
<B>spread sheet</B></A>.
<P>

<B>2012 Planning:</B> Again, KB1LDM, KB1POR and N7FMH, Fred planned on going to MT Washington
to man up forthe Golden Packet and Operation ON-Target experiment on Saturday 21 July.
<P>

<B>2011 Success:</B> Fred, N7FMH was planning the treck, but couldn't make it.  So
AA1WI, Brian volunteered to change his plans from Sugarloaf to Mt Washington.  Best we
can tell he had a D710 (because we saw it in a photo).  Apparently the RFI and intermod
was so high up there, that he was unable to make any maaningful contact on 445.925
coordination frequency. 
Further compounding the problem was that there was no NewHempshire relay this year.  
This meant that we had to hope that the link from Grelyock to Mt Washington could
be made in one hop.  See the 
<A HREF="link-Mtwash-greylock.JPG"><B> RF link to Greylock</B></A> and the
<A HREF="link-Mtwash-katahdin.JPG"><B> RF link to Katahdin</B></A>.  Anyway, 
Brian set up MTWASH-13 and was seen at least as far as the
GD-hill (non working digi) station and also on KATAHDIN. See his
<A HREF="mtwashington2011.txt"><B> 2011 report</B></A>.
<P>
An interesting contributing story was the conincidental presence of Geoff, KB1POR also
on top of MT washington for the day.  He also contributed significantly to the event
doing a QSO with Katahdin direct.  
See <A HREF="mtwash-kb1por2011.txt"><B> the KB1POR story</B></A>.


<P>

<B>2010 was vacant:</B>  Jerry Belden, N2FSD attempted to put together a team with his
ATV vehicle at the NH ATV club event that was also on the mountain that day.  
Never heard what happened and why they were not seen...
  For 2009 , Mt Washington was operational though
it was quite isolated without either of the adjacnet sites on the air.
<A HREF="MtWash.txt"><B>See the 2009 report.</B></A>
<P>

<B>See the <A HREF="../at-golden-packet.html"><B>Golden Packet plan</B></A>. </B> . 

This is one of the 15 hill-top sites from Georgia to Maine we hope to visit
this summer on 26 July for 6 hours to attempt to relay a text message using hand-held
radios the 2000 mile length of the Appalachain trail.  This is to be a no impact 
<A HREF="http://www.lnt.org"><B>Leave-No-Trace</B></A> type of event of a few 
individuals at each site. . Other hikers equipped with APRS ham radios are welcome to participate 
with advance notice.
<P>
<P>
<B>Mount Washington</B> is an outstanding radio location in Northeast New Hempshire.
It has tourist access and, unfortunatelly, extreme weather that can change
rapidly.  We are still looking for a team in that area.

As  you can see, lots of room at the top even after the $28 entrance fee!  And to the
right you can see John on a summer day.

<B>Best Location:</B> As you can see from the google path views above, the ideal location for
the APRS digiepater is at the southern tip of the parking lot.  EXCEPT that it is still too close
to all the QRM, RFI and intermod.  The ideal station could be hiked several hundred feed down
the ridge to the south and still have a perfectly clear shot to Greylock and to Sugarloaf.  There
is a huge area out there (though unprotected)...
<P>

<IMG SRC="mt-washington-bldgs.jpg">

Its a pretty balt spot up there and very exposed to the elements.  
In the view above, you can see the two levels of parking lots and the official weather
station buildings on the top.

<B>John Brigggs KC6TVF reports:</B> <i>As of 14/22 July,
We are good to go on Mt Washington and will monitor the UHF simplex and 
repeater above.  Will also have HF for fun...  I have been in contact with 
Dale Paquin to the south.  I have not been able to contact Dave, KQ1L...
I'll be in the Mt Washington area on Saturday 25 July and do some 
experimenting on regular APRS Freq.  If I need anything I can coordinate 
with Paul KA5FPT to bring it on the 26th.  KQ1L thinks the link should 
be no problem and I have been on Mt Washington and the line of sight is 
breath taking.  So no testing has been done to date.  Access will be no 
problem on the Mt Washington road, provided there is no severe weather that 
day.  </i>
<P>

Prevoiusly reported: <i>We more than likely will be supporting the Maine Forest
Rally the weekend before (17 and 18 July).  
We might be able to get an extra person or two from the MARA club to 
help out on the 26th.

The from Greylock goes 48 miles to the N1NCI-3 digipeater in New Hempshire
which will be set to the event frequency termporarily for this event.  From there
it goes the 100 miles to Mt Washington as shown above.  

<P>
Originally, the shot to the Sugarloaf resort area looked promising, but further
investigation revealed the site there was hard to access and had a very high
RF interference potential.  For this reason, a more circuitous route to the
south via the KQ1L-6 digipeater was selected:
<P>
<IMG SRC="MtWashington-to-Katahdin.jpg">
<P>
The path from Mt Washington to the KQ1L-6 digipeater is 91 miles appears to
be a good link as shown by KX4O's analysis.

<B>DETAIL LINK ANALYSIS BY KX4O:</B>  Be sure to follow the two RF links at the
top of this page to see the excellent and very detailed RF link analysis
performed for every link in this project by KX4O John Huggins.  
Each RF link shows the terrain map
elevations, the AT trail in yellow, the RF path loss itself 
including fresnel zones and finally a
statistical plot of the probabilities of link availability.  We will very
much be looking at the results of this project compared to the pre-event
analysis and predictions.  All of KX4O's links are shown on his
