Katahdyn Mountains                                           22 July 2013
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim reports:

Hiked Chimney Pond to Cathedral to Baxter Peak. I was essentially solo 
for the most part, my partner had to turn back.

Heard John @ Sugarloaf on 70cm very good sigs.

WX was horrible! 56 degrees, light to moderate rain, some hail, high 
winds near zero visibility at times, otherwise 50ft vis.

Exchanged packets at 12:00 with Mtwash and Sugrloaf fine business. 
Weak phone sigs to MtWash but copyable.

Saw Sugarloaf, Washington, Equinox and Greylock on APRS station list, 
so they were being repeated or just plain heard via HOP7-7 digi path. 
I ONLY used the rubber duck due to weather conditions.

John was kind enough to "see" me below treeline, I had to retreat when 
the hail hit around 12:20. We were in constant phone and digi contact 
until about 15:00

I hope this was a success! 

Thanks everyone for making the trip once again! 
I'll do this in almost any WX!!!

Also Posted on the way up:

Just started raining on Baxter Peak (Katahdin) 

I'm solo unfortunately, lost my partner on the hike up, he will descend 
safely I'm sure of that, we have meet up plans and he will have a truck. 
Glad to be in a cabin tonight :)

Summit report: Light Rain, 50ft visibility, very windy, 56 degrees F

I'm going to position myself towards Sugarloaf just below treeline in 
30 minutes or so. Turning rig on then. I likely have to bail at 13:30 
if the weather is difficult.

In great spirits though! Hope to make QSOs!
