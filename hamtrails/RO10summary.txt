Steve Williams KI4ZUI and I started up to Roan Mountain at about 
11:00am.  We arrived at the Roan Mountain Gate at about 11:30pm
and Todd Morgan AL0I was already there waiting for us.

We found out that access to the top of Roan Mountain was not 
permitted as the gate was locked.  Trying not to waste our efforts 
we decided to try a lookout a couple of hundred yards over the pass 
on the Tennessee side of the border.

We set up Steve' s Elk on a 20 foot mast and began Digi-peating.
We were able to communicate Voice and Digital with the station on
Clingman's Dome.  We received packets from Clingman and from 
Springer Mountain.

We were very disappointed when we found out that Comers Rock was 
again unmanned.  We feel that this defeats the purpose of the 
exercise and it needs to be corrected or this event is useless and 
a waste of everyone's time.
