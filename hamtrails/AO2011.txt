AT Golden Packet Apple Orchard Mountain 2011 Results:

AOMTN Team: Chuck, K4QS, Jim, NX4Q, David, N4WDC Since this site was 
the location of an FAA radar installation, we had to park about 3/4 
mile and hike south on the AT in order to not violate the "Do Not 
Enter" sign. The AT followed along the western ridgeline through the 
"Guillotine" then up to the top. 

We carried a 33 AHr gell cell strapped to two of the 10 ft. poles.
We had some A123 nanophospate cells, but just not sure they would last, 
not knowing how much power we would need.

We set up on top of Apple Orchard Mtn. just east of the AT AOMTN 
marker. See pic.  We used a Diamond X510N omni atop 30 ft. of 1 1/2 
inch galvanized pipe.  The mast was leaned against an old dead tree, 
but was guyed to support.  The feedline was about 60 ft of LMR400.

The Kenwood TM-D710 was configured in accordance with WB4APR's 
instructions.

We went live at 1052 EDT. Mike, KI4RIX, about blew me off the rocks 
when he came booming in on the UHF voice freq about 1145! Mike could 
copy me reliably at the low power setting on the D710. John, KX4O, 
atop Hawksbill Mtn needed me on the mid power setting.

We were able to see packets as far north as GDHill-8 and 5PTS-8 and
as far south as Springer-1. Our digipeater appeared to repeat without 
any problems.  

We had to shutdown at 1545 due to an approaching storm coming in 
from the southwest.  I would like to have stayed longer, but the 
only shelter was the radar installation with posted signs everywhere 
stating "Keep Out" or you will be prosecuted!

Several AT hikers stopped by to see what we were doing, no further 
interest noted.  We didn't run across any black bears, but did see 
bear scat (fortunately it didn't have any bits of gnashed up HT in 
it).

The temp was a pleasant 85 and sunny.

Chuck made a successful SOTA activation of Apple Orchard Mtn, W4/RA-
001 with 19 CW QSOs in the log book!  Cave Mountain Lake Campground 
was very enjoyable.  Looking forward to next year when I'll be in 
better shape!

David, N4WDC
