Jorge de la Torre [ki4sgu@arrl.net] Reports:

Great event none the less, albeit I'm reasonably sure that the 
ROAN-3 <> COMERS-4 <> AOMTN-5 links seem to have been nonexistent 
(mostly COMERS) almost everything else I was able to see from my 
vantage point was was working, OK ... not all the same time, nor as 
per schedule, but working

Our plan was to be at the trail head no later than 0900 and 
preferably be on top by 1100 so we could have all of the antennas 
setup and working. I looks like we have lots of folks coming, should 
be lots of fun.

The support teams will be on the air about the same time, they will 
tracking WX and APRS data from the internet enabled spots. This will 
help with confirmations, etc. See you all there.
