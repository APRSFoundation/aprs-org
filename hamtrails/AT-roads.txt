POSSIBLE APPALACHIAN TRAIL SITES                        14 Nov 02
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This list is just a "draft" of all locations along the trail that
intersect access roads.  I need your help (since I am relatively 
new to the trail) to help me with two things:  

1) I just jotted these down from a map, and they probably are NOT 
the best names or nomenclature that are used for these locations 
by the official AT trail folks.  Tell me the official names for
these locations...

2) If you have personal knowledge of these locations and where
manned shelter, and power might probably be available, let me 
know.  If you know that such facilities are NOT near these locations,
also let me know so I can remove them from the list.

Since I will also use this list to encode starting and destination
points for each hiker, I need to get this list under 90 (it is 105
now).  Then I can encode them in a single byte in APRS...  

Here is the draft list starting in Maine and going down to Georgia.
The APRS column indicates whether there is a possible location for
power and a shelter for a PC station.  The distance shows the 
distance from the trail itself (though some areas every hiker may
in fact leave the trail because the goodies are so tempting anyway).
I marked those that appear to be in towns or other places where we 
might find a place to put the PC indoors and sheltered with a ?.  
When we get feedback from someone that has visited the site and
confirms that it is a good location for an APRS PC, we mark it with
either "!" for excellent or "*" for most likely....  A single dot
"." indicates that there is nothing there and zero potential.
