We had the following volunteers.

Glenn N4AZR
Steve KI4ZUI
Todd AL0I
Eric KZ5ED

Two D700's for APRS Duties.

One was the Digipeater the second which we designated ROAN-4 was used
with a computer running XASTIR to compose and send messages and 
beacons and to plot the positions we received. This proved to be very 
useful as we had many people as us what we were doing and we were able 
to show them.

We had a FT8800 in the second vehicle that was used to communicate on 
440.

We heard both on voice and digitally Comers Rock and Clingmans Dome.
Both were solid copy for the whole event.

We had cell phones but no service from Sprint or Verizon

Two 40 Foot Fiberglass Push Up Masts. One had a J pole Second had a 
Comet 2/70 antenna.

We had a 2 Meter antenna on truck connected to the second D700 for 
messaging and plotting.

We had a FT857 connected to a ATS120 screwdriver antenna.  We heard 
nothing on either the 40 meter or 20 meter frequencies.

I had my digi KZ5ED-4 set to the 144.340 frequency but did not turn 
logging on so I did not get the log.  I also turned off the 
DIGIPEATER and the IGATING as I thought they would not be part of the 
plan.  I am glad that Todd had his on.

Hope that helps with the drawing  and anything else

Eric
