<P>

There are lots of opportunites to go mountaintopping during our 6 hour
26 July 2009 Golden Packet test from Georgia to Maine as we attempt to relay 
a text message using hand-held radios the 2000 mile length of the Appalachain trail.  
 See the <A HREF="../at-golden-packet.html"><B>Golden Packet
plan</B></A>. . Other hikers equipped with APRS ham radios are welcome to participate
during the hiker window and these secondary links described on this page
 can help extent the experience over most of the Eastern
states.
<P>

<B>SECONDARY LINK STATIONS</B> From the Mountains of this event, we have the potential 
to extend secondary linear links to some major
areas.  These links will be operated ONE-WAY-OUTWARD during the first hour of the event
so that they do not contribute any added load on the network until after 
the Golden Packets have been successful.  But even during this first hour, 
these one-way outpbound links will let lots of additional stations monitor
the success of the network.
<P>

After the first hour, these secondary link stations can come on line and join the fray.
But remember, only one packet per station per 10 minutes is the norm to keep loading
on the long haul network light.

<B>SPLIT FREQUENCY OPERATION:</B>
On the secondary link digipeater that is the one that connects the
secondary link to the Appalachian Trail event site shown in green above, 
that digi must operate
SPLIT frequency initially so as to not add any QRM to the main event
channel.  This is done by setting in two channels for the event.  One
channel is the 144.34 simplex digital event like all of the main
event stations, and the other channel is
operated by these secondary stations as 144.34 +600 KHz offset as shown above.
<P>

This first digi in this secondary chain will digipeat ALL Event traffic
over to 144.94 which is an unused channel in most areas.  This prevents
any packets from this station and others along the secondary link from
injecting any packets onto the
main channel.  But, during this first hour the next secondary station 
in this secondary chain
may operate REVERSE so that it can communicate with the first digi.
And each station further down the chain can also alternate between
144.34 +600 and that same setting REVERSE.  Notice that setting
REVERSE is the same thing as operating on 144.94 with a MINUS 600 offset.
<P>

Using this technique creative neworks can be established 
radiating outward anywhere on the trail as long as ALL such packets are 
*NOT* on the main event channel during the golden hour (noon to 1 PM).  
Using this split frequency approach, those secondary areas are 
able to participate and to demonstrate their ability to join the long-haul 
emergency network in time of disaster.

<B>SECONDARY LINK CHAINS:</B>  In order to allow maximum RF participation 
throughout the 13 states and more of the AT, there can be Secondary 
LINK CHAINS that will relay the actual Golden Packet event outward from 
the trail in favorable directions.  For example, the path from Springer
Mountain westward over to Lookout Mountain in Chatanooga and from there on to
Huntsville Alabama should work fine.


The goal of this event is to break the mold of Field Day and VHF contesting 
and do something different.  To test and demonstrate our ability to build an 
instant ad-hoc linear network using APRS (or packet) for long-haul RF digital 
communications.  The view below shows the path from Lookout Mountain to 
Huntsville.

<P>
The next view shows the path from Lookout Mountain to Springer Mountain.  This
path is a one-way path this year so that Chatanooga and Huntsville can monitor
the AT Golden Packet event without adding any channel QRM.  But it is a good
test run for the next year, when we will activate all Secondary Links.

<IMG SRC="LO2Springer.jpg">
<P>
As you can see, Lookout Mountain is an easy Drive-up mountain and the RF paths are
well known because of the multiple Amateur Radio repeaters already up there.  The
XXXXX APRS digi is also active from that location.
