Regarding not being heard by White Rock Cliffs or Comers Rock:

This makes no sense to me.  I heard the digi on my route back down  
from the hill to a funeral reception, beaconed through it a number of  
times, and another ham in town heard and worked it as well.  If 685  
could be heard, the digi should also have been heard unless I had it  
on the wrong frequency or something equally stupid, but I checked it  
today, 144.34 Mhz.  Go figure.

I heard absolutely no activity on the 685 repeater, monitored most of  
the time except when I was at the funeral gathering. So if it was  
heard 100% of the time, either no one tried to call me or they did it  
for the two hour window that I was not monitoring.

Digi was on air from about 5 pm the prior evening through 5 pm  
Sunday.  The beacon transmitter was shut down around 11 a.m.  There  
were two of us in the echolink conference, along with the moderator.   
I heard a lot of repeaters ID'ing but only the Mount Washington  
Station and I were on site.  We both quit around 12:15.
