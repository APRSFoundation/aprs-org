At Lookout Mountain, TN near Chattanooga we were able to hear 
Clingman's Dome, Springer, and Huntsville and send and receive 
messages to all.  Never did hear Roan-3 although we turned the beam 
right at them, although that would be about 180 mile trip as I 
figure it. Having two beams would have been a plus although we could 
copy both Springer and Clingman's off the back of the one beam as it 
was pointed toward Huntsville.  

We were up at noon and down at 1415 EDT, perhaps before Roan got 
their technical problems solved.  We used a D-710 for the .34-.94 
Huntsville link and a D-700 for the .34 digi later in the exercise.  
We also tried the Comet dual band collinear vertical, but got better 
gain with the beam.  We used the Comet as another APRS station on 
the standard frequency along with a IC-706 with Signalink, AGPWE, 
and UI-View. I tried to connect to the Echolink Conference through 
my Sprint aircard, but could never establish a connection, although 
I could see all the stations that were online.

There were three of us at the Lookout Mountain site: Van, KK4US, 
Roy, whose call I missed (from nearby Ooltewah, TN, and me, Don, 
WA4YYM.  It was a fun exercise.and I hope to participate again in the 
future.
