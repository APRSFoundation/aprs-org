Successes:   
Communications with Greylock Mountain (KB1LOY) on UHF 445.925 
simplex, several beacons received on APRS, 144.34, and brief voice 
checks on 144.34.  Echolink to the WASHDC conference node.   

Discussion:  
ECHOLINK:  We established Echolink to the WASHDC conference at 
11:00 am and continued to hold the link through about 12:30 pm.  
Talked with Apple Orchard mostly.  Found that the 144.39 Augusta 
repeater I was using for the Echolink shares the same PL tone as 
the Mt Equinox repeater in VT.  I was bringing up both repeaters 
at the same time.  This caused some confusion in the Equinox 
area but I tried to clearly state what was going on to the guys 
there and they were understanding.  We cleared off Echolink at 
12:30 pm and stayed off their repeater for the remainder of the 
day.   We should investigate an Echolink node on a discrete 
frequency to use avoid the multiple repeater issue.  

REPEATERS:  Too many repeaters in the northeast on the same PL 
tone.  This included the Echolink repeater mentioned above and 
the 147.21 repeater to talk with the guys from the Merrymeeting 
Amateur Radio Association (our home club).  Tremendous coverage 
to all of New England, even simplex, from the highest mountain 
top in New England.  

APRS Relay Stations:  No communications with KQ1L.  We tried 
several times to get a response from KQ1L-6 with no replies.  
No beacons heard from KQ1L-6.  No voice communications with 
anyone associated with KQ1L nodes.  Not sure what happened 
there.  

No communications with Dale Paquin (N1NCI).  Email from him 
indicated a radio failure that precluded him from playing.  No 
voice communications on the designated UHF simplex either. 
Some successes in communicating with the next station to the 
south, Greylock Mountain.  We established voice communications 
on the UHF simplex 445.925 frequency.  This proved useful to 
coordinate activities.  APRS contacts on 144.34 were sporadic 
at best.  We saw several successfully decoded beacons.  These 
showed a path of 147 miles at 220 degrees.  Greylock never 
showed any successfully decoded beacons or messages from us.  
They could hear the sounds but nothing passed decoding.   We 
did try several brief voice comms on 144.34 to test the path.  
Those were clear and readable.  

We established voice communication with Bruce (W1ZE) and Donny 
(WD1F) on 147.21.  We were interested to see if our D700 was 
putting out a good signal on APRS.  We had them listen on 144.34 
with their TNC to see if they could see our APRS beacons.  Bruce 
has some non-decoded packets but Donny had full copy.  

EQUIPMENT USED:  We had a Kenwood D700 mounted in the vehicle.  
The antenna is a Larsen NMO 2/70 dual band.  The Kenwood radio 
also uses a DCI dual band filter in the antenna line to help 
remove out of band RF sources, and there were quite a few on 
the mountain.  There is a second radio in the truck, an Icom 
IC-2100.  The antenna is a Larsen 5/8 wave NMO150B single band 
antenna mounted on the vehicle.  All antennas use NMO mounts 
in the center of the roof of the truck.  We were using high 
power to communicate with Greylock Mountain.  We could use 
medium power to communicate with all other stations.

OPERATIONS:  We were set up and running by 9:30 am.  We closed 
up and started down the mountain at about 2:30 pm.  The auto 
road to the top of the mountain opens at 8:00am and closes at 
6:45 pm.  Cost is $28.00 per vehicle and $3.00 for each extra 
body.  The road can accommodate full size pickup trucks but it 
is steep, curvy, and narrow.   The road is 8 miles from the 
bottom to the top and an elevation change of about 5300 feet.  
Summit elevation is 6288 feet.  It is important to note that 
weather is variable to a major degree.  Both days show 
temperature differences from the valley to the summit of over 
20 degrees F.
