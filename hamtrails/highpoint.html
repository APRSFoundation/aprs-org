<B>2011 Report:</B> Gordon Beattie, W2TTT and Steve Holly, WI2W set up an alternate
test site on High Point on Sunday, but didn't have any APRS radios that could digipeat.
They used two Alinco DR-135TP radios with the packet interface installed connected
to two copper pipe J-poles.  The reason for this test is because this site could
be  a possible one-hop bypass of
<A HREF="camelback.html"><B>Camelback</B></A> and
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/hamtrails/sams-pt.html"><B>Sam's Point</B></A>.  
<P>

If Highpoint could reliably hear
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/hamtrails/GDhill.html"><B>GD Hill</B></A> and
<A HREF="greylock.html"><B> Greylock</B></A> in Massachussets, then we might be able to use
one less hop next year.  The goal this year was for Gordon and Steve, to capture 
packets for 4 hours at their site so we could analyze the paths later.  See their
<A HREF="HighpointNJ/highpoint-LOG2011.txt"><B>packet log</B></A>.  Bob analyzed the data and
found 4 anomalous paths of note. See his <A HREF="HighpointNJ/highpoint-log-summary.txt"><B>summary</B></A>.

<P>
<B>It appears that this will not work.</B>  Not a single packet was heard direct from Greylock or GD Hill.
  
<P>
Unfortunately, they had to leave their gear operating in the parking lot about 50'
below the monument peak.  This could have blocked the direct path in both directions
depending on exact angles.  Their log seems to show that all packets they heard were
only via the adjacent Camelback and Sam's point digis.  See their
<A HREF="HighpointNJ/highpoint2011.txt"><B> 2011 report</B></A>.
<P>

<B>Prior Reports:</B>  None.  This site has not been tried before.
<P>

<B>Highpoint, NJ:</B>  This site is a great drive-up park with monument as seen to the right.
But if you zoom in like this on Google Earth, you will see a clear bubble grow as you get 
closer.  Click on the bubble and you get a full 360 dgree view as if you are standing right there.
You can look at your feet and see the cracks in the concrete, or turn and look up at the 
monument, or look anywhere else with your mouse.  It is amazing!.  The Google Earth views
are fantastic for Shack-Potato hams, but we hope someone will go there each year to help
us with this event!

<B>See the <A HREF="../at-golden-packet.html"><B>Golden Packet plan</B></A>. </B> . 
This is one of the 15 hill-top sites from Georgia to Maine we hope to visit
each summer in late July for 4 hours to attempt to relay a text message using hand-held
radios the 2000 mile length of the Appalachain trail.  This is to be a no impact 
<A HREF="http://www.lnt.org"><B>Leave-No-Trace</B></A> type of event of a few 
individuals at each site. . Other hikers equipped with APRS ham radios are welcome to participate 
with advance notice.
