KPC3+ Settings for Golden Packet Event                  19 July 2010
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason we do not recommend using a home-brew radio/TNC combo is
the track record of over 90% of the existing digipeaters on the air
that are terribly configured and aligned.  Yes, they "work" for
nearby digi's and stations, but typically suffer 20 dB or more of
poor performance which can DRASTICALLY undermine the weak signal
needs of this event.

The most important thing about setting up a digi is proper setting 
of the radio/TNC interface with proper attention to more than a
dozen hardware issues such as tone SKEW, BALANCE, modulation type,
deviation, levels, distortion, overmodulation.  The biggest need is
a direct discriminator and modulator connection for flat response.
COnnecting to the speaker and mic assures a the use of PRE and DE
emphasis which loses 6 dB or more of performance.

That is why we recommend using the D700 or FTM-350 all-in-one
factory aligned TNC/Radio combos.

Getting the hardware and/or settings wrong can lose 20 dB on weak 
signal performance andd we need every single dB.  And I would say 
that 90% (yes, 90%) of most TNC digipeaters on the air are abominable!

Once all that is set corretly, then the only settings for the TNC are:

MYCALL to your chosen mountain name
UIFLOOD HOP,ID
UITRACE TEMP
BTEXT  !DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.mmW;comment
UNPROTO set to HOP7-7,HOP7-7
BEACON 10

For a beacon every 10 minutes.  Using the site's exact LAT/LONG 
given on the AT-Golden-Packet web page for that site.  

Be sure and test it before you leave to be sure the format is 
decodable.  THen follow all the ideas in the CHECKLIST.TXT file...

I think that should do it. Did I forget anything?  
Then set the radio fo 144.34 during the event.
