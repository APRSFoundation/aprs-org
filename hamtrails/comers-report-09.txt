2009 Comer's Rock Event Summary                           28 Jul 09
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I made the trip to Comer's Rock this morning. All the way up I 
listened for packets. Got to the top and found the house from the 
pictures but could not find the overlook. I didn't get out and look 
though since it was pouring rain :( Had I found it I could have 
taken the equipment and made an attempt with my vertical. I stayed 
a bit a then figured it was a bust so headed back.  Sorry.
