*                  ATGP 2018 Report for MT Utwsayantha                   75
***************************************************************************

This was my first time participating and I was able to scrounge up a 710 
and 72 for use during the event in addition to my ftm350 and I covered 
Mt Utsayantha in Stamford NY just West of Albany. We were on the air but 
9:10 and dispite the location and to my surprise we could only hear Greylock 
and Equinox direct. As the various links came up and successfully 
digipeating we ended up copying stations 1-14. We even tried putting the 
antenna 60' up the fire tower with no improvement in reception over a mag 
mount on the vehicle. We could only hear Equinox via UHF as well. This 3214 
feet apparently was not enough to link to the stations South of us which 
was quite surprising. I figured we would at least hear Sam's Point.

I am looking forward to next year and would be willing to possibly try a new 
location or find someone real good with heights to set the station and 
operate it from the Top of the tower and no feedline to the ground.

--------------------------
We did have access into the fire tower but I personally can only make it 
halfway up due to a unpleasant relationship with heights. We did try 
placing our antenna up at that height but only had 8x @150' length and 
it made no improvement on received packets and UHF coms got worse. Access 
to the building observation tower is possible but is no where near the 
60' of the fire tower. One of my helpers did go up to the top with a 
small yagi and HT and didn't hear anything different on the UHF voice 
frequency. It was a long shot but we did try.

I would be willing to go to sometime with some more equipment and see 
what we could do via Sam's and the next station south. Voice equipment 
or non-digipeating would be easier to obtain on this end for testing 
since I had to borrow the Kenwood's but I have a ftm350AR. To the North 
Equinox was by far a winner over Graylock In signal strength.

As for the discussion about a 9600 backbone I am fairly sure something 
could be arranged there. The biggest hinderance would be a certified 
and insured climber to do that work.

I doubt that you can find a better spot than Utsayantha for propagation or 
convenience anywhere in the western Catskills.  The Village of Stamford 
owns the fire tower and the wooden observation tower, and I think access 
can be arranged.  The observation tower has AC power.

If Sam's Point was hearing you over top of the central Catskills, you should 
be able to hit Camelback with a directional antenna.  A more detailed 
propagation survey would help.  Add 60 ft to Utsayantha's elevation of 3214 ft.

If Utsayantha can link with Camelback, as well as the established link to 
Equinox, we could extend the chain beyond the present end points by skipping 
Greylock and Sam's Point with some packets.  

I spent hours in that fire tower sixty plus years ago with the USAF Ground 
Observer Corps during Saturday exercises.  We had a GOC post in the village, 
but all manned fire towers were also in GOC so I would hike up the mountain 
on a Saturday and do my thing while enjoying the scenery.  Access is through 
a trap door at the top of the stairway.  I doubt that I still have the 
combination to the lock.

By the way, the mountain is name for a legendary Indian princess in a story 
that was probably fabricated by the hotel proprietors in Stamford about 150 
years ago.

MDMTNS-7 in 2018 

--------------------------
John -

I was operating MDMTNS-7 yesterday 21 July.  When I saw your packets from 
Mt. Utsayantha, I about jumped from my comfortable chair.  I was at
MDMTNS-7 because we suddenly had a need for some local ops to step up and 
fill some gaps.

My long-term plan had been to go to Stamford (my old home town) and put 
Utsayantha into the ATGP network.  I went on the mountain in May to check 
propagation and intermod, and I was successful with the regular APRS digis 
on Greylock and Equinox (actually Equinox was better) but I had nothing to 
check on Camelback. There was some skepticism here about the path from 
Utsayantha to Camelback, but I figured that I could bend the signal around 
some of the higher (by not much) hills and make it.

That's the brief story so far.

Now, how did you make out with connections?  I'm sure you could hit Equinox, 
but how did you go south?

Here are the two packets that I caught from you:

UTSAY>TRRS9T,MDMTNS-7*,HOP7-2,HOP7-7:`f?Bl  #/]">m}=
N2YP>4R2S9S,MDMTNS-7*,HOP7-3,7-7:`f?Bl  v\`">i}GP MT UTSAYANTHA_"

According another HT that I was monitoring your first packet was from a 
Kenwood TM-D710, and the second one from a Yaesu FTM-350 (or 400).  
Of course, Kenwoods are the standard in this operation because they digipeat, 
and the Yaesu's do not.  I have both, and they are useful for different 
purposes.  I was running the MDMTNS-7 digipeater with a TM-D710A.

My logger was an old Kenwood TH-D7G with a terminal emulator on my notebook 
computer to monitor the transmissions from my digi. That's why you see 
MDMTNS-7* as the first alias in the path.

Your decremented HOP count received by my digi was HOP7-3, and it transmitted 
7-2 to the next node and to my logger.  The repeat count of your packet to me 
would have been 4.  You sent 7-7, the others repeated it as 7-6, 7-5, 7-4, 
and then 7-3 as I received it and then passed it as 7-2.  That is one more 
hop than the "short route" which would be 
UTSAY>SAMSPT-10>CMLBK-9>GDHILL-8>MDMTNS-7.  I suspect that it first went
north to either EQUINX-12 or GRYLCK-11>, then 
SAMSPT-10>CMLBK-9>GDHILL-8>MDMTNS-7.

The repeat count of your second packet, from N2YP, would be 3 by the same 
reasoning, probably via the "short route."

In either case, with Utsayantha being able to hit Equinox, as I know we can, 
and Sams Point to the south, as I think we have seen, we might eliminate 
one node in the chain and extend the system by one link using HOP7-7,HOP7-7.  
If Utsayantha could hit Camelback, probably with a directional antenna, that 
would allow extension by two links.

Again, many thanks for activating Utsayantha.  I would like to stay in touch 
and maybe work out some more details.

I'm familiar with Unadilla, too, because in one of my earlier lives I was 
the D&H Railroad Track Supervisor at Oneonta.  I laid the rail through Wells 
Bridge in 1970.  It might still be there.  Do you know any Otego firemen who 
were D&H railroaders, too?

73,
