1144:  Wow just got a blast of air traffic control on my receiver. I turned 
on VHF AIP, menu setting 103 to help.

Oh for a cavity.

I guess it is obvious by now I could not decode Hawksbill packets reliably 
despite very successful, after some cell phone coaching by Eric (TU), 
attempts at moving the AOMTN antenna to bring its signal from about 3 bars 
to well over 8+.

I never had a problem decoding anything else. Hawksbill never had a problem 
decoding anyone else including AOMTN. I just could not decode Hawksbill.

Signal strength was not an issue. When I listened to the audio I could hear 
some distortion. I recorded it for later analysis. Perhaps multipath?

9600?
By the way, before AOMTN and Hawksbill signed off near 3 pm, we both 
switched to 9600 to see what would happen. Perfect decode both ways.
This isn't the first time Kenwoods have proven they do 9600 better than 
1200, so this is another data point confirming that fact. Jeff Thomas 
(wa4zko) has preached about this before.

The ATGP never fails to entertain and we get to breath fresh air as well.
