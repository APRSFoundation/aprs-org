***************************************************************************

Shawn, N3AE and Detrick, K4IZ, arrived at the Upper Hawksbill parking area
at 08:30.  Detrick was a last minute fill-in for Eric, WG3K, who was 
dealing with a family emergency.  Detrick's help was MUCH appreciated.  

We had some light drizzle on the way up to Hawksbill peak. Advance photo
recon using pictures on the web suggested a novel way to anchor N3AE's
fiberglass mast at the observation area.  The area is surrounded by a stone
wall.  But at one point there is a 2" drain extending through the wall at 
its base. We put a long bungee through the pipe, grabbed the other end 
and basically made a vertical bungee band around the stone wall.  The 
fiberglass mast was lashed to the bungee with some cable ties.  This worked
very well, even with the wind we experiences at the summit.

Our antenna was a home brew roll up J-pole suspended on top of the 15 ft
mast.  Rig was a Kenwood D700 pre-configured for the GP event by WG3K.
Power was a 25AH LiFePO4 battery.  No laptop.

We got on the air at about 10:00 and quickly copied beacons from MDMTN
to the north.  AOMTN came up a bit later, but there were issues between
AOMTN and Hawksbill.  More on that later.

Our weather turned from light drizzle to more of a mist and fog as we 
were "in the clouds."  Over the course of the event, the clouds briefly
opened up several times for a great view of the valley below.

Hawksbill Mountain is the highest point in Shenandoah National Park and
as such has numerous hikers coming up regardless of the weather. We
were always asked about what we were doing.  Guesses ranged from the 
correct answer, amateur radio, to conducting some kind of weather 
research.  I think the GP event provided more of an opportunity to 
discuss and present amateur radio than any field day event I have ever
participated in.

Mid event we were visited by Eric, W4EON, and his grandson.

Regarding the challenges between AOMTN and Hawksbill... AOMTN reported
that they could hear us but rarely were able to decode our packets.
MDMTN to the north had no issues hearing us and decoding our beacons.
We never had problems hearing and decoding AOMTN.  AOMTN reported no 
problems hearing and decoding beacons to their south.  So the issue
was just AOMTN decoding Hawksbill.

We tried changing power level to see if RF feedback was the culprit but
that made no difference.  We briefly changed frequency to 144.39 and 
launched a beacon or two.  Detrick used his smart phone to access aprs.fi
and there we were.  Good decoded packets received by at least three stations.

After coodinating with WG3K, John at AOMTN relocated their antenna.  This
had the positive effect of significantly increasing our received signal
strength at AOMTN but they still issues decoding our packets.

Other tests followed, such as us changing frequency 5 KHz up and 5 KHz down
thinking there might be an oscillator error in the D700.  AOMTN did't hear
us when off-frequency so that was not the issue.

My personal theory is that a strong and persistent multipath exists between
Hawksbill and AOMTN, causing enough received symbol overlap at AOMTN to make
good packet decodes difficult.  Around 1500, both we and AOMTN switched to
9600 baud briefly and SUCCESS.  They heard and decoded our beacons and we
heard and decoded theirs without problems.  This might support the multipath
theory since signal timing changes with the different baud rates.  Or the
Kenwood D7xx series is better dealing with 9600 baud. Over to the experts to
think about this further.

Shortly after 1500 we secured our operation and hiked down to the parking 
area, followed by a difficult drive home due to the pouring rain to the east.

Other lessons learned...it would sure have been nice to have a small laptop
to monitor the packet traffic.  Maintaining situational awareness using
only the D700's front panel display is not very effective.
