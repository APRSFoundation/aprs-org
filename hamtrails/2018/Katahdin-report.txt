***************************************************************************


Team Katahdin (Leo KC1FOD, Gene, Tim KA1YBS) are all ready to climb to the 
summit of Baxter Peak on Saturday!

The WX this year looks to be FANTASTIC (rare!) So we should be enjoying 
more scenery for once!

We are all set, batteries charged up. Having a cold one :)

I (Tim) will CQ to aprs-is a few times on hike up on 144.39 with my Yaesu 
FT1D. I will change frequencies and path, etc. as we summit. We will be 
listening on the 70cm voice frequency. The three of us plan to hike together.

We will digipeat with a Kenwood TH-D72A HT on top. I copied the settings 
from the ATGP web link, and am bringing a paper and cell phone copy with me.

It's supposed to be an amazingly clear and warm day for us in northern Maine, 
this is a rare treat! Definitely we will take lots of pictures this time 
around.

Thank you to all the operators out there... without you, we wouldn't be 
able to relish in the excitement every year! 

Our plan is to coordinate with Mt. Washington and our Canadian brothers 
on baud rate, etc. Once we summit. We should be able to do 1200/9600 
digipeating without issues. We are lucky not to have to deal with intermod 
on our summit.
