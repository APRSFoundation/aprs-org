<P>
<B>Sand Mountain</B> is ideally located SE of Wythville in a location that has
a rare view between mountains back to Roan mountain with no obstructions and
also has a view to the Northeast to Apple Orchard Mountain.  It is a non public
site but is a sharp peak with several commercial and government relay buildings.
The aerial view below suggests there is room for a car or two at the top.  So
far, access is unknown.
<P>

K4IJ reports:  there is a digi on Sand. KW4FM-14 (not sure of the sid). 
It does a very good job around the area. The owner is Fred. [Bob comment:
 but I cannot find it on the APRS system?  Maybe a packet node?]

<i>It took a bit longer than I had wanted, but we finally began talking about this
on the net tonight. I suspect that we will be able to find some folks to cover
the Clingmans, Roan or Sand Mountains. Once we have some specific
volunteers named, I'll e-mail you to let you know for sure of there
participation.</i>

<i>Still no luck getting in touch with Fred KW4FM. I sent him an email last 
night but haven't seen anything yet. I can't commit yet but I may be 
able to run my D700 from Sand that day. I will check into what it takes 
to get access to the site. If I remember correctly it's not easy and the 
road is ruff.</i>
<P>

<B>Mike Knight K4IJ </B> [k4ij*comcast.net] reports: . <i> Would love to help. 
I know owners of repeaters on Sand and Apple. 
Not sure about Roan. Is that on the TN/VA line?
The one problem I know of on Sand is heavy paging interference. 
My friend has a 2m repeater there that gets blasted. 
... Also, there is a digi on Sand. KW4FM-3. It does a very good job around the area. 
The owner is Fred. You might want to contact him.</i>

<B>Pete Lascell</B> [plascell*verizon.net] reports:

<i>I have never been to the Sand Mtn site at Wytheville, VA.  It is a locked
gate access.  I think access can be had via the local two-way radio shop.  I
spoke to them many months ago when we were looking for 241 GHz paths beyond
100 km from Apple Orchard.  I think they said we would have to be on the
roof of the building for LOS to Apple Orchard.  It is a 3 hour drive from
Lynchburg, one way, to scope it out, so it was put on the back burner . . .
<P>
You might check out <A HREF="http://www.varepeaters.com/"><B>VA Repeater list</B></A>
  for digi operators in
Roanoke and west.  I am not familiar with them other than the web site.  I
found it trying to chase the K4YW system which is in Wytheville, but on Big
Walker Mtn.
<P>
This <A HREF="http://www.city-data.com/towers/lmobile-Wytheville-Virginia.html">
<B>towers site</B></A> shows Two-Way Radio, Inc as the dealer who has access.</i>
<P>
The next two images show the Google Earth views of the RF paths from Roan Mountain to the 
from the southwest to Sand Mountain and from Sand Mountain to Apple Orchard Mountain..

<B>BACKGROUND: </B> See <A HREF="../at-golden-packet.html"><B> AT Golden Packet main page</B></A>. .
  The purpose of this event is to field enough 
amateur radio emergency communications teams on mountain peaks in the Eastern USA
to be able to communicate 
<A HREF="../aprs-messaging.html"><B>packets and APRS messages</B></A>
 from end-to-end of the Appalachian Trail.
Normally considered a 2000 mile hike, the RF path is on the order of only 1200
miles and we hope to do this in only 14 hops.  

<P>
<B>WHEN:</B>  This APRS Appalachian Trail Golden Packet Amateur Radio event will
target either saturday or sunday of the 25/26th weekend in July to coincide with 
the ending of the 
<A HREF="http://www.vermont2009.org/"><B>Biennial Appalachian Trail Festival</B></A>
 July 17 - 24, 2009 at 
Castleton State College, Rutland, VT.  The weekend before, the 18th and 19th
is the 
<A HREF="http://www.arrl.org/contests/soapbox/index.html?con_id=94&amp;call=W4IY&amp;bbycall=1">
<B>CQ World Wide VHF Contest</B></A>, and the  Scouts
<A HREF="http://www.ontargetbsa.org/about.htm"><B> On-Target</B></A> exercise.
  Those two opportunites
are great pre-cursors for checking out the Golden Packet digipeater sites a week in advance
as well as Field Day on June the 27/28th.
<P>

<B>VOLUNTEERS: </B> We need volunteers for the 15 or so stations along the route, but also it 
would be nice to get an amateur radio booth at the AT Festival to recruit some hikers
into amateur radio.  Showing them what we can do with our HT's should have some interest
to a few of them.  Most day hikers are really into GPS, so why not APRS too? . 
To sign up as a volunteer anywhere along the trail either contact wb4apr at amsat dot org. 
or the existing team that you see forming at each site on each of the individual
web pages..
