Golden Packet D700 portable DIGI CONFIGURATION:          20 JULY 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The fundamental requirements for a temporary Golden Packet Digi are:

* Support HOPn-N paths (with 1 level of trace history)
* Support TEMPn-N paths with tracing
* Posit Beacon once every 10 minutes via HOP7-7,HOP7-7 (mainline stn)
* Posit Beacon once every 10 min via TEMP2-2 (alternate station)
* Do not support WIDEn-N

There are many ways to operate one of the AT stations, but the 
fundamental functions that must be accomplished in using the D700, 
D710, D72 or FTM-350 as a digipeater are the following.  On the D700, 
these all must be set using a PC terminal program.  On the D710, and 
72 they are all available via the APRS menus... See the separate help
file for that radio.  I dont know about the FTM-350 so someone could 
really help out here by sharing with us the settings for that radio 
too.

STATION FUNCTIONS: (Set from the front panel MENU)
 - Enter MYCALL for your site
 - Enter LAT/LON POSITION for your site
 - set to beacon once every 10 minutes
 - Using the path of HOP7-7,HOP7-7 (mainline, TEMP2-2 alternate)

STATIONS FUNCTIONS SET FROM PC PORT
 - Set MYCALL for your site plus SSID
 - Set BTEXT !DDMM.mmN/DDDMM.mmW;comments
 - Set UNPROTO APGOLD VIA HOP7-7,HOP7-7
 - Set BEACON EVERY 60  (that's 10 minutes)
 - UIFLOOD HOP,ID
 - UITRACE TEMP
 - HID OFF

To avoid all the potential problems of client software that can 
inadvertently change parameters and settings in any TNC, it is 
reeommended that the D72/D700/D710/FTM350 digi be completely stand 
alone and operated in APRS mode or PACKET mode according to the 
above settings.

TEST though, because I am not sure how TNC parameters get saved
in a PM and/or if the UIFLOOD and UITRACE parametrs get saved in
the PM or not..

To communicate and operate a full APRS station at the same location, 
it is recommeded that a second low-power radio and APRS station be 
used and that the callsign be the same root call as the station call 
but without an SSID.  So for example, GDHILL-8 is our digipeater and
GDHILL is the call of our operating station.  This way both stations
will receive any incoming messages, but only the one with matching 
SSID's will ack.

AUTO PM-STORE-OFF!  What follows are the exact settings for each 
radio.  It is VERY important for setting up these radios for special 
events that you be sure and set the AUTO-PM-STORE to OFF!  This 
makes sure that once you store the configuration in a PM, that any 
screw-ups in operations will not automatically overwrite the desired 
config that you originally saved...  The configuration remains as
programmed until you RE-SAVE the PM.  You can set this AUTO-PM-
STORE-OFF in each PM, so remember to do it if you set up multiple
PM's.


AT EVENT DIGIPEATER SETTINGS FOR THE D700:
------------------------------------------

1) Prior to event, make these TNC settings in PACKET mode using 
a dumb terminal.  These settings can remain permanently in the
radio and it can still used normally on the normal APRS channel
or it can be used for Field Day or the Annual AT event or any
other emergency where HOPn-N or TEMPn-N paths are used.

 - UIFLOOD HOP,ID
 - UITRACE TEMP
 - HID OFF

If you are going to operate the radio in APRS mode, then all the
rest of the settings you make in APRS Mode.  But if you are 
going to operate in PACKET mode, you have to also set the 
BTEXT, UNPROTO, and BEACON TNC commands listed earlier if they
are not  provided by any client APRS software.

2) Power cycle radio and then test the digipeater with another 
radio using HOP7-7.  It should digipeat, and substitute its own
call (MYDIGI) and decrement the N number.  The digipeated path 
should look like this:  W3XYZ>APRSAT,MYDIGI,HOP7-6:.......

3) For the event, then set APRS mode and these MENU items:
   RADIO - DISPLAY - KEY FUNCTION MODE3 (D700 only)
   RADIO - MEMORY - AUTO PM STORE OFF   (D700)
   AUX   - AUTO PM STORE OFF            (D710)
   APRS  - MYCALL to your assigned station call-SSID
   APRS  - GPS UNIT OFF
   APRS  - MY POS (set to your assigned position, see web page)
   APRS  - STATION ICON (set to digipeater star)
   APRS  - STATUS TEXT (set as required, but keep it short!)
   APRS  - STATUS TX RATE 1/1
   APRS  - PACKET PATH HOP7-7,HOP7-7 (Mainline, TEMP2-2 if alt)
   APRS  - PACKET TX AUTO
   APRS  - TX INTERVAL 10 minutes

3a) Again, if operating PACKET mode, then you have to also
set up the TNC BTEXT, BEACON and UNPROTO commands if not done
by any client software.

4) BAND-A set to 144.34 MHz, volume up, DATA channel, SQL tight

5) BAND-B set to 445.925 MHz

6) FUNCTION - PM-IN - PM#  Save this for rapid reconfiguration.

7) Cycle F Function button (including holding 1 sec) until you 
get the TNC button on the lower left.  Cycle it until you get 
the APRS TNC display in the upper left of the display.

8) Cycle F button to find the "BCON" button, and cycle it until 
BCON displays on the top line of the display to enable beacons.

Operating procedures will be in a different file: AT-checklist.txt
