COMERS ROCK - 2016,  John KK4BSM
--------------------------------

Comers Rock had issues with both our D700As yesterday.  

For the record, we were able to see from Roan-3, to Equinox-12 on 1200, 
and at least 3-9 on 9600.  UHF voice to both neighbors worked fine.

Generated beacons worked fine, but strangely, both rigs would not 
digipeat decoded packets.  We hadn't touched anything since last year, 
so settings should have remained the same.  

While attempting to look at UIDIGI settings, we were plagued with serial 
issues.  Despite bringing extensive cabling and software, we lacked a 
"gender-bender" serial adapter.  We spent over an hour trying to jerry-
rig a jumper wire equivalent with no success.  Zach, KJ4QLP is still 
trying to diagnose the issue.  I'll report back if I hear from him.

Setup
2 x D700As
1 x Diamond X-50 at 15' (9913 coax)
2 x 7Ah SLAB batteries
2 x Linux/Windows laptops

VTARA will try upgrading to a D710GA before next year.
Apologies for being "that" station.

John, KK4BSM
