CAMELBACK-9 Report 2016
-----------------------
Kevin McCauley KB3EJM

I arrived at the top of camelback at 0930 and was up and running by 0946.
My intentions were most to monitor the event and trouble shoot the the 
permanent repeater.I had my d700 pre configured and 2 old beam antennas, 
two 7amph batteries in parallel and a harbor freight solar panel to keep 
the batteries topped off. Was up and running by 0946.The very first packet 
heard at 0946 was Ezinox-12; @ 0948  GRYLCK-11;@ 0949  AB1PH-12 ; @ 0953  
SLIDE-10 ;@ 0957  CAMLBK-9 ;@ 1123  HWKSBL-6 ;@ 1124  GDHILL-8 ;@ 1128  
MDMTN-7; @ 1151  AOMTN-5.

These were the first stations heard repeating form the permanent repeater 
(camlbk-9) . I took screen shots of the rest of the event to follow.
I'm still trouble shooting why I was not able to decode and re-transmit 
on 9600. However my beacons could be heard both north and south. Also I 
did not hear nor was I heard on UHF. I did notice that when I tried to 
switch A band for B band the tuning knob was skipping the menu wildly to 
the point I couldn't send text or set the frequencies any more so I'm 
attributing the problems t my radio. Before switching the A band for the 
B band, with the advice from Lynn I had messaged slide-10 to start hop7-7' 
I had received an ack and he was able to start the chain from me northward. 

I saw no issues with the permanent repeater and seemed to skip mountains. 
I'm currently scouting new areas to set up another repeater as camlbk-9 is 
sharing a space with the 145.010 main digipeater/ node for this area. 
Blue mountain ski area seems very willing to accommodate us at the moment 
and I will see how the coverage will be. Another site on the AP trail 
would be tott gap mtn (40.96.96N, 75.59.58W) which has an open north/ 
south view.

The camlbk-9 repeater is in the privy on top of Big Pocono state park. 
It consists of a KPC+ TNC a Yaesu 2 meter pushing 25 watts and a F22A a
ntenna and coax donated by KE3MX. DCNR has been very open and kind to our 
needs and seems willing to help us any way they can. thank you DCNR. 
A lot of members of KB3YMY set these repeaters and I thank them too. 
Our next project is in the works of setting up a hammesh system. Donald-
WK2RP had made it to the top of the mountain towards the end of the event 
to help me break things down. He also acted as PI for this event with 
all the curious onlookers.

Screenshots of the home monitoring of the event will follow within the 
next couple days. Kevin-KB3EJM
