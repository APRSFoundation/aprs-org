*        ATGP 2019 Report for Mount St Joseph  (Canada)  by Dan VA2KEY   75
***************************************************************************

Left the west-island of Montreal at 720, got to the summit of the drive-up 
around 11.  I called Shack Potato to check in and said I'd be OTA in 30 
minutes. 

Turned on the TH D-72 and beaconed my location on 144.39, retuned HT to 
144.34 and continued beaconing. 

 I brought along an old scanner connected to a homebrew vertical dipole 
with the scanners audio output into a laptop running DireWolf (software 
TNC).  My intention was to log the packets coming across my summit.  First 
lesson learned : I quickly realised that my homebrew dipole heard way 
fewer stations than my TM-D710.  The better way to do logging is to 
interface the main radio with the better antenna.  This "logging" station 
didn't hear Tim on Kathadin.  I'm attaching the log file, if anyone's 
interested. 

For the TM-D710 configuration, I relied on an old PM that I didn't review 
before heading out. Luckily, Lynn talked me through the proper config.  
Second lesson learned : ALWAYS check the config beforehand. 

I had solid voice contact with Kathadin.  I called out on voice to 
MT-Washington but didn't hear back. Packet to MT-Washington worked. 

I was glad to see packets from Mt-Carleton and MT-Blanc, so my main 
station could hear Kathadin.

My wife came along and we had a nice picnic.  GP is a Great reason to 
head out to the mountains.  

My location was:
Latitude	45.44757299	45° 26' 51? N
Longitude	-71.12033188	71° 7' 13? W

I think this location is a capable replacement to SugarLoaf.
