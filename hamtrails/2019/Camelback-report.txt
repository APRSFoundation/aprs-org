Beautiful day on top of MtPocono state park for the APRS 2019 ATGP event.  
This years team was Frank W3OKW and NJ3U Rory.

Rory arrived at approx 0900 and proceeded to set up Diamond 2/440 Omni for 
APRS packets at 40 feet on mil surplus mast sections.  Voice was covered
with a 2/440 Yagi at 40 on mil masts .  Radios where Kenwood D710 for 
packet and Yaesu FTM400xdr for voice.  Power was over 32ah of AGM s
upplemented by rigid solar panels .  Vehicle batteries where available as 
a benefit of drive up site!

Initial voice coms to SamsPt where excellent as we worked to trouble shoot 
his config- that effort broke off as his Astron decided to release the 
magic smoke forcing a hasty retreat into his car for backup position.   
We found the issue and he was beaconing in short order.   GDHill voice has 
weak until we Armstrong’d the Yagi around to Bobs heading and that have us 
59 with voice to GDHill and still had solid coms to SamsPt off the back 
side of the beam.

We saw packets end to end including MtStJo but never Sugrlf .   Worked with 
WB4APR Bob to trouble shoot Maryland Mt deaf receiver and started seeing 
more Southern stations coming up the trail.

Saw first GP from KATHDN-15 @1338 so after followed up with SPRNGR-1 GP.

Switched to 9600 bd and reduced bcon rates as directed by Lynn and GDHill.

Passed 9600 packets solid to our N&S links.

Secured ops at 1500 per GDHill and passed message North to SamsPt via voice 
to pass North.

Off the CAMLBK-9 approx 1615.

Lessons learned - 1) bring logging PC to capture info - nothing other the 
D710 and a couple notes - Good thing we have Lynn monitoring the traffic 
for analysis !   2) Yagi on a mast and high power is the solution for 
solid voice.  3) QRM is heard on this location but didn’t effect packets 
or voice coms.

Thnx to the entire ATGP team for another successful and fun exercise !  
Special thanks to my teammate on CAMLBK-9 Frank W3OKW.
