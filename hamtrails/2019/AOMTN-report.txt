       Apple Orchard Mountain for APRS Golden Packet and SOTA
          Sat 20 July 2019          Amateur Radio
APRS Summits on the Air (SOTA) APRS Golden Packet Apple Orchard W4V/RA-001 

I must be a glutton for punishment. This is my third time visiting Apple 
Orchard Mountain (AO) and its steep climb to the top with way too much 
stuff. But I’m always rewarded in the end with awesome views, excellent 
VHF and UHF range, and interesting phenomena. This trip was no different.

Stats
When: 2019-07-19 and 2019-07-20
Where: Apple Orchard Mountain - W4V/RA-001
Who: Eric WG3K, Amanda KI4IWS, Harlan, and Elise
Ascent: 280ft in .58mi (3928ft to 4208ft)
Antenna: SOTABEAM Bandspringer Midi antenna
Equipment:  Elecraft KX3, Kenwood D700A, Opek HVU-500

APRS Coverage: Excellent with nearby I-Gate. Use path WIDE2-1 on your HT 
when up here to reduce interference and unneeded repeats.
The mission
Each year, several amateur radio operators make the hike (or drive if you’re 
lucky) to a pre-determined mountain summit along the Appalachian Trail (AT) 
to create an ad-hoc packet network based on the APRS protocol. This "event" 
is titled, simply, the APRS Golden Packet Event. From Springer Mountain in 
Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, (and now we’re including some summits 
in Canada as well!) we create a digital network comprised of fourteen 
digipeaters that can be used to pass along positions and messages along the 
AT. AO Mountain is station five in the network and links Comers Rock with 
Hawksbill Mountain, each just more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) in 
distance.
The team
In years past, I’ve been accompanied by some experienced operators that made 
such a trip enjoyable and easy. In 2016 I was joined by Steve N3IPN and Dave 
KB3RAN on what ended up being a big learning experience of what not to do 
when climbing AO Mountain. Too much heavy stuff ended up on that trip which 
led to a re-evaluation of what we really needed to bring on these trips. In 
2017 we added Ed KC3EN to the group and lightened our load a bit. Many feet 
make light work, especially when you decide not to bring so much junk with 
you.

This year was a bit different. The people I asked were on travel or were 
otherwise engaged. I was planning on doing this trip solo when, at the last 
minute, my family decided to join me. Elise hadn’t really been camping 
before and Harlan hadn’t been truly camping outside of a campground so I 
figured it was about time to get them out into nature.
Staying there
 
This year we made camp at the summit. Besides the industrial complex that 
has been constructed at the top, much of the summit area is natural, green, 
and pretty. The paved road makes it easy, well easier, to get up to the 
summit with lots of stuff. Camping at the top is awesome with clear, starlit 
skies, and a nice breeze blowing around.
APRS Golden Packet
Since we camped at the summit there was no rush to set up the digipeater 
and make sure everything would be up and running prior to the event. In 
fact, I was able to get the system up and running, by myself, in just a 
few minutes.

This year I used a different antenna setup that yielded excellent results. 
Instead of a base station antenna, as I’ve tried in the past, I used an 
Opek HVU-500 mobile antenna for 6m, 2m, and 70cm. Coupled with an MFJ-1401 
antenna ground plane kit, used for converting mobile antennas into base 
antennas, along with three fiberglass mast pipes each measuring 1.13m in 
length, the Opek did a fantastic job and was much easier to haul around 
and was still lightweight. This setup will definitely go into my portable 
setup.

I’m continuing to use my LiFePO4 battery. This year I added a 18-watt solar 
panel to help extend my battery’s capacity. The solar charger, unfortunately, 
failed at some point in middle of operations and I didn’t realized it until 
I had been operating HF off of the battery for a while. Fortunately, the 
charger started working later in the mission but only generated enough to 
keep the voltage up when the sun came out from behind the clouds.
Signals and operations
Signals between AO Mountain and Hawksbill Mountain have traditionally been 
the weak link in the Golden Packet network. I figured out my first year 
that antenna placement is very important on the summit. If this were my 
land I think I’d put in a survey marker at the spot to make sure I can come 
back to the exact same spot each time.

Signals, compared to years past, were great going both north and south. 
I never heard Hawksbill on UHF voice but I copied their packets on VHF with 
no problem. Comer’s Rock has never been a problem and I chatted regularly 
with KJ4OAP throughout the day.

One thing that seemed annoying to me was when we were trying to complete 
Golden Packet exchange, I was losing power, and all the digipeaters in 
between were sending their position reports. Each report that went through 
my station drained my battery a little bit more. So instead of being there 
for the Golden Packets, I was being killed by extra traffic. And that 
damned cloud wouldn’t move out of the way to help charge my battery! But, 
in the end, the cloud moved, the station stabilized, and we moved on to 
complete the pass.

After passing the Golden Packet each way at 1200 baud, we switched to 9600 
baud and completed the same Golden Packet in just a few minutes. 9600 baud 
apparently doubles the ALOHA channel capacity and also seems to do better 
along some of our weaker paths. I saw no problems at AO Mountain.
Summits on the Air (SOTA)

As usual, I brought my Elecraft KX3 along with my SOTABEAMS Bandspringer 
Midi antenna and 4.1m fiberglass pole. The antenna continues to perform well 
and is the easiest and fastest antenna I’ve found to erect for HF.

I started at 60m and went to 20m putting stations in the log on every band 
I stopped in. There is really awful noise up at the top of the summit that 
has rendered my Elecraft K1 useless in previous trips. This noise was back 
and got worse the higher in frequency I went. I really wanted to do more CW 
but my filters just weren’t taking out the noise and it was difficult to 
pick out the stations. I, unfortunately, ended up with only one CW contact, 
which was a disappointment. With my power budget very low, I ended HF 
operations early to keep power for the primary mission.

I did manage fourteen contacts on five bands during the operational period 
and thank AB4PP, KG3W, W2SE, NE4TN, K2JB, KB1RJD, KI4TN, AA4IT, K1LIZ, 
W5GAI, KJ4OAP, and W5ODS for answering my calls.

Summary
Overall, the operation was a success both personally and for the Golden 
Packet team. I need to do more testing to figure out what happened with 
my solar charger but I feel that everything else went well. We’ll see what 
next year holds.
