Greetings fellow Appalachian Trail Golden Packeteers! 
 
BLUF:  Hawksbill was online, on time, and eventually digipeating.  The new 
guy didn’t screw it up too bad.  At least I hope I didn't.
 
Here is my detailed, post event report for Hawksbill Mountain.  This report 
is coming from the perspective of someone who has never taken part in the 
ATGP, or used a Kenwood radio, let alone program it for APRS digipeating.   
Some of this is basic information to most, but it is coming from the 
perspective of a “newbie” to all the systems I used on Saturday.  I hope it 
might provide information to someone who is on the fence about 
participating, and how, with a day of preparation, although not 
recommended, you can pull this off.
 
What started as an email to Bob (WB4APR) to gain his interest and 
availability to speak about the ATGP, and the recent launch of PSAT2 to 
the Pentagon Amateur Radio Club, quickly turned into going solo to the 
summit of Hawksbill Mountain.   What a view!  When you are up there, you 
understand why it is called Hawksbill.
 
On the Monday prior to the ATGP event, I sent an email to Bob.  In the 
email I mentioned I had graduated from the Naval Academy (I got there a 
year after Bob), was a retired Marine helicopter pilot, a ham, and lived 
in Fredericksburg, VA.  I also mentioned I was “thinking” about going to 
one of the ATGP sites to see what it was all about, and learn more about 
APRS and packet.  
 
I have never met Bob, but I knew of him through ham radio.  As you are 
all aware, all you need to do is search the internet for anything 
regarding APRS, you’ll find Bob.  Bob got straight to the point, “It looks 
like Hawksbill is still not covered which is a huge gap in the chain.  
That should not be far from Fredericksburg if you can give up a Saturday 
morning for the adventure.”  I let Bob know I didn’t have a Kenwood radio, 
and had never been to Hawksbill.  Less than 24 hours later, Bob found a 
radio for me.   Where else but in the ham radio community would you find 
someone willing to loan a brand new, TM-D710A still in the box, and a 
battery box to a complete stranger.  Will (KW4WZ) did just that, and 
Wednesday afternoon, I left the pentagon for Winchester, VA to pick up a 
radio and battery box.   Work and life events prevented me from working on 
any real preparations until Friday, but I had the main piece of equipment 
needed to man Hawksbill.  Now all I needed to do was get the radio 
programmed, figure out what else I needed, and hike up a trail.   Right…..
 
From Tuesday through Friday I did what any Marine would do prior to 
executing a mission, reconnaissance.  I pulled up the Hawksbill links on 
the aprs.org website, and what’s posted on John Huggins website 
(www.hamradio.me) regarding recent trips to Hawksbill for past ATGP 
events.  I looked at google maps, google earth, information on the 
trails, parking, and whatever else I could find regarding prior year’s 
Hawksbill support.  Not having been there before and with limited 
pictures from past events, I wasn’t exactly sure what it would be like 
or what I would need.  What I did find was Hawksbill has had some 
communication issues in the past.  Communications going north were never 
an issue; it was going south where the problem lies.  So here I am, the 
new guy going solo to Hawksbill, a potential comm void, with a new radio 
to take part in something I have no experience with.  What could possibly 
go wrong?
 
With some help from Bob on Friday morning, I went out to my vehicle in 
the pentagon parking lot, programmed the radio, and saved everything 
into memory.
 
THE GEAR:  To prepare, I figured I would start with the basic items 
required to operate the station, and go from there.  I would need a radio, 
antenna, battery, and coax.  Here is what I was starting with:
 
Radio – Kenwood TM-D710A, borrowed
Antenna – Diamond X-50, already owned one
Battery – Hammo-PWR 12Ah, borrowed
Coax – 50’ RG-58, already owned it
 
These were the basic items needed and anything else I brought would have 
to allow me to operate more efficiently, or get the signal out better.  
Not knowing what to expect I ended up taking too much with me, but I had 
what I needed to operate and make Hawksbill function.  Additional items 
I took which I ended up using:  

6 x 16.9oz water bottles, frozen
550 cord (rope)
towels to cover and keep radio off the ground and out of sunlight
food, knife, wrench for antenna bolts
tape to hold mast pieces together for travel
Stakes
 
THE ROUTE:  The shortest route to the top was ¾ of a mile with an 
elevation change of 690’, Lower Hawksbill Trail.  Not a hiker, a 690’ 
change in elevation over 4,000 didn’t sound like much…..it definitely 
is when you are wearing a backpack, carrying a battery box, mast 
sections, antenna, water, and other supplies.  Using the benefits of 
hindsight, I should have taken Upper Hawksbill Trail, which is just over 
a mile in length with a 520’ elevation increase.  Maybe next year.  The 
route I chose took me approximately 1.5 hours and I was up on the top by 
0900 setting up the gear.  
 
THE SITE:  After looking at the highest point of Hawksbill, slightly to 
the south and approx. ¼ mile away, I decided to stay with the lookout 
even though it was lower than the summit.  The difference was only 
around 40 feet, but the summit was surround by tall trees and it didn’t 
have great access.  
 
SITE BUILD:  With no good area to support an antenna mast, I remember a 
previous post where the team used a bungee cord to go through the 
drainpipe and over the wall to support the mast.  I lugged up five, 4’ 
sections of military tent poles with the plan to get the antenna up as 
high as I could.  I used the 550 type cord doubled through the drain and 
over the wall to secure the top and bottom sections of the mast to the 
lookout wall and some stakes to “wedge” in between the mast and the 
drain wall to keep the mast base from moving.   One end of the looped 
550 cord was around the base of the mast, went through the drainpipe, up 
the outside of the wall, then over the top of the wall and around the 
mast again.  This was approximately 3’ from the ground.  Once I got the 
antenna assembled and clamped to a different section of mast, I 
connected the coax and temporarily lifted the antenna and an additional 
section of mast to do some initial comm testing.   The base of the 
antenna was up 12 feet with the top of the antenna approximately 17’ 
above the lookout base.
 
OPERATION:  I laid a towel on the ground to protect the radio and 
connected it to the battery box, the coax, turned it on, and waited.  
In less than a minute, I heard AOMTN-5 and could read what was sent.  
I was glad to hear something, so I was pretty sure the radio got 
programmed correctly.  It wasn’t long after that I was able to pick up 
stations 1-5, and CAMLBK-9.  Yes, that is correct, 1-5, and 9.  From 
what I can remember, I was getting a great signal coming in from both 
north and south.  5/9 from the south (AOMTN), but don’t remember the 
reading for CAMLBK.
 
TROUBLE ON HAWKSBILL – TO SQUELCH OR NOT TO SQUELCH:  By 1100, I 
wasn’t very confident the radio was transmitting, or digipeating.  
I could see information being received, but I would never see Will’s 
radio transmit.  Not being able to raise anyone on UHF (more on that 
later), I sent a text to the “Shack Potato” and after a little 
trouble shooting the issue was resolved.  Apparently, you have to have 
the squelch on for digipeat and/or beacon to function.  Never even 
crossed my mind.  Once I adjusted the squelch knob, and performed a 
beacon test, the radio came alive.  I could see the radio transmitting 
and at least felt a little better that I didn’t kill the ATGP efforts 
for the entire team.   I had the power set to high and didn’t try it 
at any other power level setting.  It was working and I brought along 
a spare, 9AH battery just in case.  I never needed it.  One other 
issue which popped up was the HOP settings programmed in the radio.  
It wasn’t until we switch to 9600 that I was notified I had it 
incorrectly set to HOP7-7,HOP7,7.  I’m not completely sure what this
does (Limits hops to a max of seven for the original packet, and an 
additional seven to get station 15?)
 
THE ENTIRE TRAIL:  Shortly after 1230, I believe after station 8 came 
alive, I started seeing the more northern stations, and by 1345, I 
heard 1-15.  
 
END GAME:  I tried to follow the flow of information, but was confused 
on when I needed to look at the main screen or look at the list of 
messages to read them.  I have no idea what was sent in the “Golden 
Packet” or when it digipeated through my node.  I do know I had to 
figure out how to switch to 9600.  I started seeing messages regarding 
9600, and was working to switch when I received a text from the “Shack 
Potato,” I assumed the GP went through fine on 1200 and 9600.  Thank 
you “Shack Potato!”
 
I never did hear anyone on UHF.  I had the “B” side of the radio set 
to 445.975 with a tone of 100.  After I got home I looked at the 
information I had received, and depending on which one I looked at, 
there were two frequencies, 445.925 and 445.975.   I was on .975, and 
I assume everyone else was on .925.  I may have that backwards.
 
THE HIKE DOWN:  The trip down the mountain was a little bit quicker 
than it was coming up.  I didn’t have the 6 bottles of water to carry, 
and with the 12 AH battery being drained to 43%; it was 57% lighter.  
Not to mention, it didn’t require any work on my part to go down the 
trail.  According to my high school science teacher, gravity was doing 
all the work….tell that to my legs, joints and feet.
 
FINAL THOUGHTS:  
 
What a great learning experience.  I understand what we did, and why 
we continue to do events like the ATGP, but I don’t completely 
understand APRS and all of its capabilities.  I still have a lot to 
learn.  Hopefully, if the time aligns again next year, I’ll do a bit 
more planning, organizing, and I can make the trek to Hawksbill 
Mountain again.
