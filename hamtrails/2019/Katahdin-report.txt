*        ATGP 2019 Report for Katahdin by Tim, KA1YBS and Leo, KC1FOD    75
***************************************************************************

Tim (KA1YBS) and I (KC1FOD) have been swamped since the event. Tim sent a 
concise and nearly complete report from the summit which I have forwarded 
below.

I'll add that while running 1200 baud we had received a beacon from every 
station both south of us to Springer and north to Mt. Carlton in Canada by 
approximately 2:30 pm.  At that time, the switch to 9600 baud came and we 
began hiking down the mountain.  The decent takes another 4 - 5 hours.
Since we did not have a way to log packets, I don't believe we can confirm 
nor deny what we digipeated or received at 9600.  I think the only way to 
know our effectiveness at 9600 is to see who else received our packets.
We operated very light with Tim's Kenwood handheld (TH-D72???) as our APRS 
digipeater.  We used a very compact camera tripod and duct tape to hold 
the Kenwood digipeater a few feed above the ground while it did its job.  
That freed us to talk with VA2KEY on Mt. St Joe and K1OK on Mt. Washington 
with our handhelds dedicated to voice.  

Tim had a Yaesu dual band (Model?) and I had a Baofeng UV-5R5.  Tim's 
Yaesu also would send and receive APRS but not digipeat.  He frequently 
used it to verify our digipeating with the antenna removed.

When you have to carry everything on your back and you must leave at 
7:00am to reach the summit at 5,267 feet by noon it really changes what 
you consider bringing.  I've attached a couple pics that might do the 
experience a little justice.

Next year I aim to bring a netbook running linux, direwolf, and xastir 
with a 9600 baud capable radio for logging and as a possible backup to 
the kenwood.  It would also allow for better messaging.

Tim, please add your thoughts or correct any omissions/errors.
It was great working with you all again this year for a super exciting event!
Extra thanks Mt. St. Joe and Mt. Washington teams for your support!

One thing I think Tim and I both have admitted is that while we love climbing 
Katahdin, the climb puts undue pressure on actually working the GP event 
itself.  I'm looking at a possible alternative peak with a less demanding 
hike that has equal access to both Mt. Washington and Mt. St. Joe.  Given 
the design of Baxter state park which encloses the tallest peaks in the area 
there is nothing close to a drive up in the immediate area.

For Canadian Stations: VA2KEY, VA2GLU, VA2JPI, VA2RBC, and others 
supporting the canadian Golden packet effort!

I'm looking to see if we have a spot here in Maine that permits more time to 
work the event and less time hiking than Katahdin requires of us.  Of 
course, I want to take on the investigation with an eye to preserving our 
connection into Canada.  Here are my questions:
•  Of the three Canadian stations (MTCARL-1,MTBLAN-2, MTSTJO-14) 
   I believe the only one we were directly communicating with was MTSTJO-14?  

•  The other side of that question is: Do MTCARL-1 and MTBLAN-2 have a 
   connection with MTSTJO-14 either directly or through a single hop?
•  Was Katahdin the only reliable connection from Canada to the US?
•  Finally, would you be able to provide/confirm your Latitude and 
   Longitude coordinates of your operating locations?  I came up with:
   o	Carlton: 47.383,-71.303
   o	St. Joe: 45.448,-71.120
   o	Mt. Blanc: ?,?
Mt. Washington: K10K and WA1KLI, I have my eye out to improve or maintain 
our connection with you as well.  I just don't have any of these questions 
about your location.
