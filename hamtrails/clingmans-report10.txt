2010 AT Event Clingman's Dome REPORT                        26 Jul 10
---------------------------------------------------------------------

William McKeehan, KI4HDU reports:

Things at Clingman's Dome went well today.

As planned, AJ4HV & K4RTW pulled a camper to the Clingman's Dome 
parking lot out of which we operated all day. The shelter was great 
all day, but especially welcomed when the rain came in this afternoon.

KF4QVI and KG4DSP provided the radios (two TM-D700s), a computer 
(which we used to monitor most of the day) and antenna masts.

I delivered two three-element beam antennas and a splitter provided 
by W4VAB.

The setup was smooth and we were operational early (well before 
11 AM). After the setup, we monitored 445.925 and 144.340 for voice 
communications. We also monitored the Mt Mitchell repeater (145.190). 
Around noon, we heard signs of life from our neighbors. Both of which 
had some unexpected difficulties to overcome.

Once their stations were up and running, we were seeing and diging 
packets from both Springer Mountain and Roan Mountain.

Roan mountain reported problems communicating with any stations to 
their North. At 3PM, we gave up and shutdown.
