GOLDEN PACKET     COMM COORDINATION CHECKLIST              7 July 2016
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lessons Learned

a) importance of 2nd HT on 144.39 for receiving ANSRVR announcements
b) Temporarily turn off INTERRUPT display to see your D710 digi, 
c) New 5m BCON rate at Springer & Katahdin & GDHILL. All others 10m 
d) 4 AH battery plus a spare seems to be enough for a 3 hour event
e) Minimize messages and if used, use BLN#XXXX's to avoid ACKS.
f) Communicate status by updating your status when things change

OVERALL CHECKLIST:

1) CAMERA:  Take camera and a book. Book is in case all works 100%

2) SIGNAL MIRROR:  For signalling other peaks in view as part of the
Boy Scouts Operation On-Target or any other cooperating target.

3) ARRL PAMPHLETS:  Take Ham radio hand-out pamphlets for onlookers

4) APRS HT:  (required) Use a 2nd APRS radio (HT) to maintain APRS text
communications with the designagted Shack Potato and all other 
stations using NORMAL APRS on 144.39.  Use the root callsign of your 
station without any SSID.  Begin using it as you leave home!  
Periodically send status updates to ANSRVR with 1st words: "CQ AT ..."

See: http://aprs.org/ansrvr.html  The dual band APRS HT can also be 
used to monitor your local published Voice repeater. Use EL
power or long RG58 coax and a beam to the nearest digi to minimize
self-QRM to your primary operations on 144.34.

5) BATTERY:  You will need about 4 AHrs.  Take two to have a main and 
a spare.  And give you a half-way indication when the first one is out.
 
6) 144.34 DIGIPEATER: Set up your D7XX APRS digipeater radio BAND-A on 
144.34 MHz and set the volume so you can hear what is going on on the 
channel.  This channel is shared with Balloons and ATV, so we want to 
be aware of any conflicts, and hear how the packets are sounding...  

7) BAND-B on 445.925 MHz CTCSS 100:  Use BAND-B 445.925 simplex for
voice coordination to adjacent sites.  This avoids QRM to the 2 meter 
event band!  This is important!  Also a VOICE-RELAY around a failed
APRS mountain top will still count.

8) SETTINGS:  Set up your D700/D710 radio as a HOPn-N and TEMPn-N 
digipeater operating in APRS mode.  The D710's can all be set from the
frotn panel, but a PC is required for the initial setup of the D700 
prior to the event, but is not required during operations.  This 
digipeater radio will be used only for the 144.34 DIGI, for 
APRS DIGI beacons (STATUS text updated as needed) and for voice 
UHF coordination on 445.925 MHz voice.  See radio  settings:

www.aprs.org/hamtrails/Radios/D710-settings.txt
www.aprs.org/hamtrails/Radios/D710G-settings.txt

*** TURN OFF any AUTO-REPLY MESSAGES in the digipeater radio!

9) DUPLICATES:  The D7XX has a bug that will cause your own station 
to digipeat its OWN packet a second time.  Fortuneately the others 
digipeaters will not, because they will see that second one as a dupe.  
We just live with this quirk (and it does slightly improve success).

10) LOGGING:  If possible, have a SECOND APRS receive-only station 
running APRS on the event channel with a PC for logging all packets.  
This station can be left unattended down at the car or at home since
it can hear all packets from your station's digi. Do not let it 
beacon on the event channel! even once... too much QRM. 

11) COORDINATION/STATUS:  Use your mobile (enroute) or your APRS HT 
(note 4 above), to be in communication with everyone at all times 
on 144.39.  LOGON TO ANSRVR early on EVENT day on your normal 144.39 
APRS channel even before you leave, so that you will receive all EVENT 
group messages that day.  Checkin to either the "CQ AT" Eastern group 
or the "CQ OT" On Target group.  To do this, use your assigned station 
callsign (without SSID) send a message to ANSRVR and include in the 
message your stataus:  

MESSAGE TO:   ANSRVR
MESSAGE BODY: CQ AT  leaving home... etc...
      -or-    CQ OT  headed up the mountain to... etc

ANSRVR GROUP STATUS:  These messages will be reflected by the 
ANSRVR engine to all other similar stations who have also sent their 
message to the same AT or OT group on ANSRVR.  You will remain logged 
onto ANSRVR for a few hours, so send a new message each time your 
status changes so that others will see your status and so that you 
remain logged onto the ANSRVR.  This lets all other participants over 
the 2000 miles to see the status of all other stations in real time, 
even before the -event- links are established.

See http://aprs.org/ansrvr.html

12) BEACON RATE:  Set the Springer and Katahdin rates to 5 minutes.
If these get through, then we know the intermediate ones are still
there.  The middle GDHILL-8 will also be at 5m since its path is 
just a single HOP7-7 and will get to both ends!

If either of the end stations are not yet on line, then the next one
in can set 5 minutes until they show up.

13) DIGIPEATER CHECKOUT:  With the menu 625 INTERRUPT Display set to
FULL ALWAYS, you cannot see your own TX meter to confirm your digi
is digipeating.  Tempporarily turn it off to see if you are TXing.

14) IRLP/ECHOLINK:  As an additional exercise of own ham radio 
skills, it might be nice to try to also use your local Echolink node 
to connect to the designated ECHOLINK CONFERENCE NODE (if any) for 
the event.  This way we can all TALK if needed.  This is more of a
test of capability than essential, since few of us do this regularly.
(We should practice!)... .

15) CALLSIGNS:  Use ONLY the designated callsigns and SSID's below in
the DIGIPEATER D700/D710/D72.  The SSID's help us remember the 
sequence from Georgia to Maine.  Use the ROOT CALL (without SSID) 
for your secondary station on 144.39 but use the SSID always on 
144.34 during the event:

APPALACHIAN TRAIL     PCT TRAIL
-----------------     ---------
SPRNGR-1              SANDGO-1
CLNGMN-2              SOCAL-2
ROAN-3                etc
COMERS-4              etc
AOMTN-5
WHTRCK-6 (HWKBLL-6, or STNYMN-6)
MDMTNS-7
GDHILL-8
CAMLBK-9
SAMSPT-10
GRYLCK-11
NHRELY-12
MTWASH-13
SUGRLF-14
KATHDN-15
LOKOUT-1  Lookout montain 1 hop beyond Springer
HTSVLE-1  Huntsville, 2 hops beyond Springer
STNMTN-1  Atlanta Georgia
SAWNEE-1  Sawnee Mountain GA
BTBALD-1  Brass Town Bald
CTLINK-1  Connecticut Group if they link up
etc


16) STATUS TEXT:  Keep it updated and BRIEF.  first must be your 
FCC call, then update to inform others what is going on at your 
station.  Here are some examples:

WB4APR online 11:15
WB4APR See 3-7 and 9-12 <== showing stations heard

17) MESSAGES:  Use VERY sparingly.  APRS MESSAGES are inefficient 
since they require ACKS and severly load the channel.  Update your
STATUS text instead.  If you must send a MESSAGE be sure to send it
as a BLN#XXXXX (incrementing the # from 0 upwards for each new 
bulletin.  By using bulletins, everyone can read the mail along the 
way. The extra bytes XXXXX go along for free, so if you want to 
indicate a RECEPIENT, use their abbreviation and/or SSID there.  
Such as BLN2MD-7 would be an outgoing 2nd bulletin line to MARYLAND 
MOUNTAINS-7, though everyone else can read it along the way. 

REPLY:  If you get an incoming STATUS or BULLETIN addressed to
you, please respond in your STATUS or a BULLETIN so that the other
end konws you got it.  This has a much higher probablity of
success than ACKS.

ANSRVR MESSAGE (ANNOUNCEMENT) SERVER:  Use your 144.39 APRS HT 
to maintain your status on normal APRS via the ANSRVR using the 
CQ AT or CQ OT group as noted above.   Once every half hour or 
so, UPDATE your main-line STATUS and also send out a status 
update on 144.39 via the ANSRVR to keep everyone informed of your
status.

EVENT MESSAGES:  IF we get end-to-end main-line beacons successful,
then we may authorize an end-to-end SHORT message test.  Once those
are successful, we may authorize other aauxilliary or off-line
stations or hikers to join with their BEACONS on a 5 minute update.

EMAIL:  If you have smartphone email capabilities you can send
an occasional update on our at-golden-packet@YAHOOGROUPS.COM every 
hour or so to keep everyone informed.

MESSAGE OVERFLOW!  Be warned, the D7 and D700 can only hold 10 or 16
messages/BULLETINS and then it will REJECT ALL FURTHER MESSAGES.  
You will not be alerted, but your station will then hear no more and 
you will be jamming the net with REJECT packets.  So copy down notes 
of any important messages, because once you READ one message, the 
NOT-READ flag is cleared on ALL messages, so they are all availaible 
then for pushing out of the buffer.

*** MESSAGE BUG!!!!  There may be some D710 radios that will ACK all
incoming BULLETINS and messages to ALL.  If so, replace the radio or
update it with new firmware!

SUMMARY CHECKLIST for any COORDINATION COMMS (subject to change):

0) FRIDAY before you leave, print out this page, and adjacent sites
1) Begin day with msg to ANSRVR: CQ AT or CQ OT from root station call
2) Initial coordination on ur PUBLISHED repeater for adjacent nodes
3) Monitor 445.925 simplex direct when you are in place
4) As emergency backup VOICE on the AT channel 144.34 might work
5) Use assigned AT-CALLSIGN-SSID on DIGIPEATER station on 144.34
6) Use same root CALL on other 144.39 coordination packet station
7) Maintain your status via occasional ANSRVR message on 144.39 
8) Do not message stations on 144.34 event channel until OK'ed.
9) If you do message on .34, send to BLN#XXXXX
9) Remember all identical root callsigns will capture a message 
A) but only the SSID-MATCHING station will send back an ACK
B) Do NOT expect acks!  They are unreliable.  Assume ur msg worked.
C) Minimize messages on 144.39 due to desensing your main event RX
G) READ your incoming messages periodically to make sure your buffer
   does not saturate with unread messages and then send REJECTS
   (D700 holds 10 (or 16?) but D710 holds 100)

Save settings and callsigns in a PM, so that if power is cycled, 
you come back up and can continnue operating properly.  Be sure to
have set AUTO-PM-SAVE-OFF so that any screw-ups during operating
do not get re-saved into the PM...

Bob, WB4APR
