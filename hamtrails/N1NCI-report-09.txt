2009 New Hempshire (N1NCI) Event Summary                      28 Jul 09
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This station was not operational.  Just the day before the event, the
planned D700 radio developed an issue and was not operational for the
event.  Here is the report from Dale:

OK now I have a problem.... I took the D700 out of the car so I can set 
it up at the site and it will not power up. Worked fine in the car, set 
it up on the bench for reprogramming and it will not complete the power 
up sequence. The fan in back comes on and  the speaker has a "pop" 
sound like it is powering up but no dispaly and the audio is there but 
only for a couple seconds, then it shuts down. do you know if there is 
a memory battery as I have had this unit for a long time and this is 
the only thing I can think of why it died. It was tied directly to the 
battery while in the car for the past 4-5 years and manually turned on 
/off

Other tricks I tried was to reinstall it in the car... same results, 
Tried the reset button on the main unit no change.
