<P>
<B> The USA APRS Network in 2002:</B> This web page reflects the state of the APRS 
network in the USA as of 2002 when APRS was 10 years old.  The network was inefficient 
due to continued
support for legacy RELAY and WIDE paths which caused significant packet duplications.
 .  It was time to fine 
tune the network for the benefit
of its users and travelers.  Below was a 6 hour capture of almost 900 digipeaters taken
from the APRS Internet feed on about 12 June 2002.
<P> 
  To highlight the different types of digis, the ICONS have been temporarily
changed to some other existin symbol so that the colors can better distinguish 
the different digi types at a glance.
You can zoom to your area to better see the detail. 
The temporary symbol table is listed below to show the translation used to display the 
different types of digis on the map.

<P>  As you can see in 2002, of the 900 digis, 240 were not identified by
an overlay character to show users what kind of digi it is.  Of those, 160 were
in the USA and are shown with the red cross above.  . We really do need to
have all digi's properly identified by their capabilities and visible to users
by their overlay character.
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED OVERLAY CHARACTERS:</B>  Next is the table of OVERLAY characters that
should be used to identify the capabilities of each digipeater.
.  The overlay character is the byte between the LAT/LONG.  The "/" is
the default and conveys no information to the users.  Replace it with the proper overlay
character from the list below.

<P>
Notice that the <A HREF="http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/aprs/fix14439.html">New-N Paradigm</B></A> 
can be implemented on either the Kantronics, DIGI_NED
or UIDIG ROMS, so if implemented the "S" overlay should superscede the identification 
of the ROM since we can still tell the type by the TOCALL version field.  
The U and D overlays were only needed
back when we needed to distinguish their additional capabilities.  
. Now with the new all-North 
America <A HREF="http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/fix14439.html">New-N Paradigm</B></A>,
 the "S" is the more important overlay for those digis
that imlement it.  
<P>
Bottom line.  If it is not an "S" or "P" or "1" overlay digi in North America, then
it is probbly an old digi running on obsolete parameters.  . Please see if you can inspire
someone to fix it.

<P>
Thanks
