Subj: Section 16-104 of the Environment Article, Annotated Code of Maryland

Mr. Bruninga,

As discussed, I have attached Section 16-104 of the Environment Article, 
Annotated Code of Maryland which was amended during the 2013 General 
Assembly Session and signed by Governor O'Malley on May 16, 2013.  
The legislation allows for a variety of small-scale renewable energy 
systems to be placed on piers. It is important to note that, while the 
laws establishes criteria for solar, geothermal and wind energy systems, 
the ability of a homeowner to install those systems lies with the local 
county or municipal government and their individual Critical Area Programs.  
In drafting the legislation, I think we tried to stay true to the previous 
discussions we had on solar panels.  

So, please let me know if we were successful.

Gary
