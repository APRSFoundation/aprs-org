*      Notes on drawing home backup power from the 12v battery in a Tesla     *
*******************************************************************************

I got these comments from James Whewell:

yes it is sneaky.

It works fine with the car occupied, but in park mode, you can enable Dog mode
or Camp mode to keep things running.  I have a Relay off a circuit that remains 
on in dog mode; then I tap directly into the 12v circuit, at the DC : DC-
converter, rather than the battery, as that is what other engineers have found
the best source.  However, once an unexpected very high load, like 80A is 
detected; the Telsa goes into an error state.  The terms-and-conditions state 
you cannot run your house from an inverter from your car!!! they want to sell 
you a power wall.

Now, if you could tap the high voltage DC and get an inverter on that, it would 
be way more useful; 4kw to the house.  but that would void the warranty for sure.
