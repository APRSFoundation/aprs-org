Mammoth Cave APRS hardware list      Rev b                  25 Jan 2013
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  WB4APR
Date:  2,3 March 2013 (saturday and sunday of Cave City Hamfest)
       (Also Volunteer weekend at the Park)

Should we all bring an FRS walkie-talkie?  Or I can provide.  These are as
low as $24 a pair (462 MHz) and are useful for coordination and also as
a benchmark test of UHF at the same time (short range voice). 

Note, WB4APR has a dozen 9 AH gel cell batteries to support Boxed D700s.

At this point, we have the possibility of 16 digis.  But 9 of them will
have to be heavy and bulky D700/710 boxes.  But if we use them, we can
also do a range test at 50W too.

D72 digis:
    3 WB4APR
    1 W9RXR  also has D710 and VX8R.  4 Hrs away
    1 KD4ANG Jon (natl guard duty)
    1 KA0AZS and D7
    1 KY4JME Josh with Arrow antenna, also has D710

D700 digis. At 5W to be identical to D72 except for Vertical links.
    6 D700 WB4APR  (two 710s and four 700s)
    1 D710 W9RXR also has D72 and VX8R.  4 hrs away
    1 D700 KA0AZS (also D72 and D7) from Ohio
    1 D700 KI4RDT (Vert LInk tester w D7 and 817 combo)
    1 D710 KY4JME with Arrow Ant and also has D72

HF Combos
    2 FT817/KPC3 - WB4APR
    1 IC706/TNC  - KG4CSQ Clarksville, TN about 2 hrs away.
    1 IC706      - KA0AZS also D72,D7, D700 from Ohio
    1 FT817/KPC3 - KI4RDT (Vert LInk tester w D7 and D700) 1 Hr

Igates: KG4LVA, John.  Tested Hotel WiFi and has permanent one in B.Green

NetControl:  Need someone topside with VHF voice to area repeaters, monitoring 
    also a simplex chat frequency and with APRS display and contact with NPS 
    park personnel.

WagonMan:  May need someone to remain topside for shuttling people or gear
    or just to be available to coordinate and help.  Vehicle required.
