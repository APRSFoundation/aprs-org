KD4ANG Jon    ..   3    3   2    3   2   5  D72 Can't come due to Drill

Lodging:  Park Hotel or Campground.  Campground is first-come, but
          the season doesnt really begin for another 2 weeks so there
          should be plenty of room.

We need mostly people with APRS radios and experience.  Also, HF tests
will be welcome.  We need to match people with the test plan.  Here is 
what I am thinking for assignments.  We may as well use these as tactical 
calls too, since we dont all know each other's calls, not having operated 
together before.
