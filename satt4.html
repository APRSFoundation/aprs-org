<P>
<B>THIS PAGE needs updating, </B> but we now have 4 of these comm boards on orbit and just
built another 6 for this summers Student labs for potential future flight.  Photos to follow...
(july 2019). 
<P>

 <B>The SATT4 Comm Card </B> is a 1.5 Watt VHF communications, command and control module used in current Naval Academy student project cubesats.  It is just a new mechanical layout for the original product sold by <A HREF="http://byonics.com"><B> BYONICS.COM</B></A>.
That product called the <A HREF="http://byonics.com/mtt4b"><B>MTT4B Microtrack</B></A> is normally designed
for terrestrial use in the APRS network for mobile operators.  It has a 10 Watt power
amp on it (that we do not need on our cubesats).  So we laid out a new board with
Byonics permission and simply buy the original parts for an unassembed MTT4B to populate our
board.

An advantage of this approach is that  you can begin experimenting with this comm system
immediately by simply purchasing a factory assembled MTT4B terrestrial configuration for desk top testing of your project.

<P>

<B>Global APRS Satellite Network:</B>  When you use a SATT4 comms board on the shared
145.825 MHz satellite channel you co-exist with all the existing APRS satellites (listed below) as well
as the global network of volunteer ground stations that capture all downlinks and 
feed them into the APRS network operating in the Amateur Satellite Service shown here.
All downlink data is available live on the two web pages: 
<A HREF="http://pcsat.findu.com"><B>The APRS satellite downlink page</B></A> or the one dedicated exclusivly to the   
<A HREF="http://ariss.net"><B>ISS downlink page</B></A>:

<B>Low Cost Comms Board:</B>  Our earliest satellites used Kantronics KPC9612 (PCSAT, PCSAT2, ANDE) and KPC-3's (RAFT) packet TNC's.  Then we switched to Byonics MTT4's for RAFT, QIKCOM1 and QIKCOM2.  But now we are standardizing on the single board SATT4 as a baseline
for future missions.  It is based on the popular 
<A HREF="http://byonics.com/mtt4b"><B>Byonics MTT4B</B></A> all-in-one APRS Tiny-Track4 module.  We are standardizing the MTT4B onto a standard cubesat-104 board (and adding a 9600 baud UHF downlink if needed) to allow other schools to rapidly develop their own amateur radio cubesat projects.  We call this board the SATT4.  In the photo above, the small daughter board in the upper half of the picture is the 
<A HREF="http://www.stensat.org/products/product2.html"><B>CANSAT 9600 baud</B></A>
 UHF downlink board.  It permits higher data capacity downlinks for other missions.
It is available from the

<B>OVERVIEW:</B> . Our student satellites are undergraduate senior engineering projects to
give the students hand's on experience in their Aerospace major.  All engineering students complete a capstone project in their major. Eighty Five percent (85%) of the EE, Systems and IT projects involve wireless spectrum under the FCC rules and some Astro student projects result
in viable spacecraft (cuebsats) that are designed to operate in the Amateur Satelite Service.
As such, these cubesats
need to be low cost and hence this SATT4 low cost approach.  Shown above are the SATT4 board 
and the matching 7 volt 1800 mAh battery board and Arduino based Attitude Dynamics and Control
(ADCS) board.
<P>

<B>Battery Board:</B> To avoid the safety issues and critical charging and discharging requirements for modern LiPo batteries which require individual Baterry Management Systems (BMS) on each LiPo cell, we use NiCd batteries.  These have 60 years of space heritage, require no BMS, and can be over dischaged and overcharged by more than 10% indefinitely with no ill effects.  We use the large 1800 mAh cells because they can absorb any overcharge that might occur from a cubesat size solar panel giving us a completely safe passive charging design while also providing 12 Whrs of energy storage operating at a bus voltage between 6-7 volts.  Further, there is a current sensor for battery current and a 555 watchdog timer that must receive a repetiting heartbeat from the spacecraft CPU or it will time out after 90 seconds and reboot the power to all systems on the 5v bus.

<P>
<B>ADCS Board:</B> The ADCS board is laid out to hold either an Arduino mini-pro processor or a Parallax Basic Stamp CPU.  The board also contains six current sensors for the six solar panels and 6 channels for photo-resistor sun sensors.  It also contains a 3 axis Micromag-3 magnetometer.  All of the solar panels plug into header pins on this board which is usually the top board in the stack.  

<P>
<B>Solar Panels:</B> The solar panel connects to the ADCS board with an 8 pin connector that not only provides, power but also a sun sensor, a temperature sensor and torque coil connections for the torque coils on the front and back of each panel.  Combined in series with the pair on the opposite face, this give 4 coils in series which is a perfect impedance match with the 30 mA current direct drive capability of a 5 volt Arduino or BS2 I/O pin.  This greatly simplifes the ADCS hardware design.  A final pin feeds to a Burn-resistor trace that goes all around the panel so that the future antenna release burn resistor can be placed at dozens of locations on any panel making the final antenna release design flexible enough to meet the final flight requirements.
<P>

  Every new project based on this board adds to the existing on-orbit constellation
of amateur radio experimenter relay sateliltes pioneered with the original <A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCsat</B></A> in 2001 and our  most recent <A HREF="psat.html"><B>PSAT-1</B></A>(2015) missions noted above containing
an APRS packet radio communications transponder for relaying remote telemetry, 
sensor and user data 
from remote users and amateur radio experiments or other data sources back to 
Amateur Radio experimenters via a global network
of internet linked volunteer ground stations.  The APRS transponder also includes  
telemetry, and some command and control for the user modes. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="PSAT1U/PSAT1U-boards-PR-shot-65xx.jpg" align=right>

<B>Operations under ITU Rules:</B> These SATT4 cubesats can operate under the ITU rules of the Amateur Satellite Service as long as the mission meets the rules.  This means, no pecuniary interest, no externally funded research, no benefit to anyone other than amateur radio experimenters learning about the radio art.  A perfect match for undergraduate stuednt engineering projects.  See how our PSAT-2 design and operation fit entirely within the ITU International Amateur Radio 
<A HREF="PSAT2/PSAT2-BRICSAT2-ITU-rules.txt"><B> RULES</B></A>.  The FCC does not issue
licenses for Amateur Radio Spacecraft
<A HREF="PSAT2/FCC%20Public%20Notice-clarified-a.doc">(see public notice)</A> because they are operated under the
license of the individual amateur radio operator who is responsible to assure
that both the design and operation are within the rules of the ITU as interpreted by the IARU.  Our licensed control operator is Todd Bruner, WB1HAI in Annapolis, and Rick Hambley, W2GPS.

<B>SATT4 Digipeater Aliases:</B> To join the existing APRS satellites on orbit and operate as a seamless constellation, PSAT-2 supports the same <B>APRSAT</B> and <B>ARISS</B> generic aliases as the original 
<A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCSAT</B></A> (NO44)
<A HREF="psat.html"><B>PSAT-1</B></A> and the
<A HREF="ariss.html"><B>packet system on the ISS</B></A> so that users do not have to change any parameters when using any of these three APRS transponders.  

<P>

<P>
<B>APRS Digipeater:</B> When the DIGI is on, the satellite TOCALL is APRSON.  When it is
off for user digipeating the TOCALL is APOFF.  The digipeating ALIASes are the usual, ARISS, APRSAT (and WIDEn-N if you forget). 
<P>

<B>LIVE Telemetry Downlink:</B> will also be captured on Steve Dimse's, K4HG original
<A HREF="http://pcsat.findu.com"><B>pcsat.findu.com</B></A> web page.  APRS packet is a secondary mission compared to DTMF and PSK31, so the digipeater may be turned off if power is low.  But beacons, telemetry and Bulletins will always remain.  The five Telemetry Equations (after the serial number) in standard APRS telemetry format are:

<BR> In the 00011X00 field, only the X has meaning. 0 = DIGI ON, and 1 = Digi off

<B>Worldwide APRS Ground Station IGates:</B> Although almost all of the dozens of 145.825 MHz APRS-IS (internet system) ground stations can hear the ISS downlink with simple antennas, the map above shows the fewer ground stations that have actually IGated PSAT packets.
Although these are the same stations listening to 145.825 as the ISS, the ISS station is 14 dB stronger (10W versus 0.35W for PSAT).  So only IGates with good weak signal performace are successful with PSAT.  As you can see, we need IGates in Hawaii, India, China and the Southern Hemisphere.  PSAT-2 will operate at 2 Watts and be 7 dB stronger than PSAT-1.

<P>
<IMG SRC="psat/PSK31-uplink-antenna-plot.gif" align=right>
<img src="psat/omni-antenna-vertical-a.png" align=right>
<IMG SRC="psat/range-gain.gif">
<P>

<B>Best Satellite IGATE Antenna:</B>  The most practical IGate antenna is an OMNI (so it does not wear out or require rotators) and it has high gain above about 30 degrees and less gain on the horizon (where it cannot hear
a 350 mW satellite anyway). 
See (<A HREF="aprs-satellite-igate-antennas.html"><B>SatGate Antennas</B></A>) Not only is the gain higher at the higher elevations, but the satellite is also
 6dB closer, thus giving a combined gain of nearly 13 dBi similar to an OSCAR class beam.
 Another reason for minimizing gain on the horizon is the Donut-Hole NULL effect where any IGate that hears a
user station <i><b> direct</B></i> will send that into the APRS-IS first and that will cause the 
subsequent space digipeated packet to be a DUPE and will be ignored by all IGates.  So a mobile or
terrestrial omni is the worst omni (maximizes gain on horizon and usually has a null around 20 or 30
degrees which is where the satellite is best located!  
<P>

The best Satellite OMNI Igate antenna is
a non-gain 1/4 wave vertical (19.5" over a large ground plane).  Even better (+2 dB) is a 3/4 wave vertical
(58" high) over a large ground plane shown here.  It has nearly 7 dBi gain above 30 degrees, plus the +6 dBi closer range gain and not much at all on the horizon.  It is best placed low in the yard to further minimize horizon gain as shown here.

<P>

<B>BACKGROUND:</B> . PSAT-2 follows on to several previous student project satellites
which contain an APRS packet radio communications transponder for relaying remote telemetry, 
sensor and user data 
from remote users and amateur radio environmental experiments or other data sources back to 
Amateur Radio experimenters via a global network
of internet linked volunteer ground stations.  The data transponder also includes all 
telemetry, command and control for a complete cubesat.  A secondary transponder supports multi-user PSK31 text messaging users via a Brno University transponder. 

<P>
<B>See the 

<A HREF="psat/AMSAT-2010c.doc">Psat paper</B></A> at the 2010 AMSAT symposium
<BR><B>The image at right</B> is the test equipment used during integration testing of PSAT-1.

<P>

<B>Operations in the Amateur Satellite Service:</B>
All of the transponders on PSAT are operated in the Amateur Satellite Service to encourage 
amateur radio students, 
educators and experimenters 
around the world to contribute additional satellities to this constellation on 145.825 MHz or
to build interesting self motivated remote sensors suitable for the uplink channel.
 See our
<A HREF="buoy.html"><B>ocean or bay oceanographic data buoys</B></A> for examples.
  
This kind of Amateur Radio experimentation fits well in the ITU rules
<A HREF="PSAT2/IARU-rules-psat-2.txt"><B>(see PSAT-2 justification)</B></A> 
for operating in this service
and well serve our educational and outreach goals for student projects encouraging young people to
be interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.

<P>

<B>APRS Packet Transponder:</B> The APRS packet transponder 
is an AX.25 Packet Radio Relay similar to what is flying on 
<A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCsat</B></A> and the
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/ariss.net"><B>ISS</B></A>.  This ongoing mission in space on the original PCsat 
is now over 12 years old and pioneered
this very popular operating mode via the ISS since 2006.  Both of these 
missions deliver packets to users worldwide via the global network of
volunteer ground stations feeding the two downlink capture pages:
<A HREF="http://pcsat.aprs.org"><B>psat.aprs.org</B></A> and
<A HREF="http://ariss.net"><B>ariss.net</B></A>.  These pages display live maps such as the one
below, of the most
recent user position data and capture all message traffic between users. 
See the <A HREF="psat/APRS%20Link%20Budgets%20for%20Psat-a.doc"><B>APRS link budgets</B></A>. In addition there
is also a PSK31 transponder as noted below.
<P>

<P>

<B>Attitude Dynamics and Control System (ADCS):</B>   To maintain a very slight spin about the Z axis the solar cells are offset with a reflective strip on one edge to produce an unbalanced solar radiation pressure on each side. This should create a fractional RPM spin (the Spin on PCsat now, 12 years in orbit is maintained between about 0.6 and 0.8 RPM by this method).  And PSAT-1 typically spins between 1 and 5 RPM with this method.  The spin is needed to maintain thermal balance and not let one side get too hot facing the Sun.
<P>


<B>Global Experimental Data Channel:</B>  PSAT is the space segment of this
initiative to encourage both new satellite construction in support of this experimental
data channel and lower cost buoy and
sensor experimentation at other schools as shown below.  
Today, the only AMSAT that is available for 
no cost to schools with such experiments are the Naval Academy's PCSATs.  But with 
ParkinsonSAT we hope to commence an ongoing full time presence in
space to continue this support of the 145.825 data uplink channel for future experiments.  
To this end we hope other schools to either build additional 145.825 MHz relay satellites 
and/or to build experimental sensors.  The complete comms system including data
transponder fits on one 3.4 inch square card <B><i>shown here</B></i>.
  We hope that ParkinsonSAT will be the Egg in this 
chicken-egg conundrum.
<P>
<B>The 2016 Initial Design:</B> Below will be the more descriptive images and links to the details of PSAT-2 design.  But until we finish the new cubesat-standard-bus design for PSAT-2, we are retaining some of the olderlinks to the portions of the original PSAT-1 design that are similar.
