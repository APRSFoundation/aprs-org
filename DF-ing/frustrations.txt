FRUSTRATIONS OF THE OMNI-DF TECHNIQUE
================================================================

It has been frustrating that this most powerful contribution of 
OMNI-DFing to the self-policing of the amateur bands has not become 
second nature to HAMS.  This has nothing to do with APRS, but simply 
that the vast majority of mobile hams on the air don't realize how 
quickly they could work as a group to rapidly locate the source of 
interference.  If they would just think and make an effort...  
Here are some of the frustrations:

1) People think they cannot DF without expensive special equipment
2) People think that not hearing a signal is of no value in DFing
3) People don't instantly hit the REVERSE button on their radios when
   they hear an unwelcome signal on their repeater
4) When they do make a report, they are not careful with the details
   a) Where are they really?
   b) Do they know which direction is north if they report a direction?
   c) DO they have any clue about their antenna height gain?
   d) Are they aware of the general terrain going out a few miles?
   e) Are they listening on the right frequency?
   f) Are they actually hearing a fox or a birdie?

Although the OMNI DF technique can localize a fox to a mile or so in
only a few minutes if you can find enough people to make reports,
it is frustrating to try to solicit omni-DF info from casual operators
because of the general lack of understanding of the power of this 
technique.  Here are examples of the furstrations:

GOOD REPORT:  I'm in the center of Mudville in a mobile on average 
terrain and cannot hear the fox at all.  (Enter DFS=0)

GOOD REPORT:  I'm about 3 miles west of Tinytown in my mobile on a
slight hill with best coverage to the west and hear the fox with
a readible but noisey signal..  (Enter DFS=5)

BAD REPORTS:  
"I cant help.  I dont have any DF equipments"
"I can't help, I'm mobile"
"I can't help, I can't hear the fox"
"I don't know where the REV button is on this radio"
"I can't help, I've never done any DFing before"

Turns out, if you dial around to various repeaters on a sunday afternoon
fox hunt to solicit signal reports, you will spend 90% of your time 
explaining to the above responders why their input is so valuable
just so you can eventually get a  report out of them!

It is frustrating.  EVERY mobile operator when they hear a jammer on 
their repeater or, are asked for a signal report should have the 
understanding and knowledge to respond with usable information.
