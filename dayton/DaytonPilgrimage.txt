Dayton Mobile Settings:                                 30 April 2010
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of these items are even for NON APRS radios and users.  But for
those with APRS radios, many people never use them to their full
potential.  Here are some tips for the annual Dayton Travel weekend 
you can use to make your radio very useful to you AND to others.  
Here are the topics in this file:

- Voice Channels and Voice Alert
- Milemarks for tracking other voice users
- DTMF reporting via APRStt
- Load OBJECTS:  TRAFFC, WRECK, SLOW, STOPPD, POLICE, SMOKIE, DONUTS
- Community Digipeater Settings to benefit travelers


ALL TRAVELERS AND ALL RADIOS EVEN WITHOUT APRS:
-----------------------------------------------

- Monitor 146.52, and/or 144.39 with CTCSS 100

146.52 is great for stumbling into existing QSO's but unless you call
CQ there every 2 minutes, you may miss others passing.  Instead, 
monitor 144.39 with CTCSS 100.  Whenever any other APRS mobile
running APRS voice alert gets within simplex range, you will 
automatically hear a fractional second tone burst once every minute 
or so from their APRS Voice Alert System.  

VOICE ALERT:  Only the direct packets from an APRS mobile running
Voice Alert have CTCSS 100 on them.  This isolates them from the
hundreds of other digipeated packets that saturate the channel.  By
setting CTCSS 100 and monitoring the channel, you can hear when another
voice operator running voice alert is in range.  When you hear one,
just key up, make voice contact and QSY to 52 or 446.00 (so you are 
not competing with all the other packets on the 144.39 channel).  
446.00 is preferred by APRS operators, since the UHF will not 
interfere with their APRS reception while talking.

Even if you are not running APRS, you can still monitor for these
other operators.  Why is this better than 52?  Because it is like an 
automatic "CQ 52"  once a minute.  This guarantees you will be able 
to make contact even in a passing situation.  On 52, most contacts 
are ships-passing-in-the-night completely unaware of each other 
unless everyone is calling CQ every minute the entire trip.  In a 
crossing situation, you are only in simplex range for about 3 minutes 
or so (2 miles a minute crossing situation).

By using the automatic APRS Voice Alert system, you can't miss 
someone.  Come join us. 

NON-APRS TRACKING TO DAYTON:  Even if you don't run APRS or a GPS but 
do have an old TNC, you too can be tracked within a few tens of miles 
all the way to Dayton.  This is because the Global APRS system can at 
least identify where was the last digipeater that heard your TNC.  Just 
make these basic settings in the TNC:

 MYCALL (your call)
 BTEXT Dayton or bust (or suitable short text)
 BEACON once every 3 minutes
 UNPROTO APRSBT VIA WIDE2-2

Even without a position report, this packet, anywhere, anytime on 
the APRS frequency (144.39 in America) will allow your position to
be identified to the nearest 10 to 20 miles or so.  Tell family to
use this URL (with your callsign):

http://www.findu.com/cgi-bin/find.cgi?call=wb4apr&vicinity=1

Notice that it is just a normal FINDU.COM URL, but you add 
"&vicinity=1" on the end of it to tell it to display the nearest
digi that heard you.


VOICE ALERT WITHOUT APRS?!  Sure, anyone can receive voice alert 
just by setting CTCSS on 144.39.  But you can also PING if you 
want.  Just load something like ">Joe Enroute Dayton Voice Alert" 
into the Btext of any old TNC and set the beacon rate to once 
every minute, again with CTCSS 100.  Now all APRS people will 
hear you when they get in simplex range of you and may call you 
and you both then can go to 52.  Be sure to set your UNPROTO 
PATH to "UNPROTO APRS" without any digipeaters, because beyond 
simplex range, you are only QRM.  see this web page:

                 http://aprs.org/VoiceAlert3.html


FOR USERS WITH APRS RADIOS!
-----------------------------

APRS MOBILE SETTINGS FOR DAYTON:  Set your TNC or tracker to the 
path of VIA WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1.  This will get you out farther than 
you can talk though any voice repeater, and should be sufficient.  
Set your beacon rate to 1 minute and proportional pathing if you
have it so that you have 1 minute updates locally, but less QRM
farther away.  Anything over 3 minutes is too old and at 140 MPH
crossing speeds you can miss each other.

APRS LAPTOP SETTINGS FOR DAYTON:  First, let someone else drive 
so you can spend the 8 hour trip playing APRS like never before.  
Use the above path, but also put whatever Voice channel you are 
monitoring, make sure that is included in your POSIT PACKET so 
that all other APRS mobiles can see what voice repeater you are 
monitoring.

SOFTWARE SELECTION AND MILEMARKS:  Make sure you use an APRS 
program that fully supports the fundamental milemarks and Dead-
reckoning!

MILE-MARKS:  Most mobiles will not have APRS, but ALL of them 
will know their position by their milemark.  APRS has a built 
in mile-mark system that will allow you to place someone you are 
in QSO with on the map by just asking them their mile mark, 
entering the route number and mile mark, and BINGO you have 
placed a vehicle object on the map at their location.  Assuming 
they are headed to Dayton, then you can enter an estimated CSE
and SPEED.  

From that point on, that CAR and its object will continue to move 
on your APRS map toward Dayton and so even without GPS, you have 
a good approximation where that person is.  You can AMAZE him by 
calling him every half  hour or so and mentioning "I see you are 
approaching Crabtown".  "How can you tell that?"  Because I am 
tracking you with APRS.  "But I don't have APRS".  And you answer.  
"But I do"...

MILEMARKS and Dead Reckoning were fundamental to allow APRS to 
see the Tactical Situation around them, INCLUDING all stations 
participating even if they don't have APRS.  Once you put "joe" 
on the map moving to Dayton, ALL OTHER APRS mobiles within 100 
miles or more of you will also see JOE on their maps.  And if 
they have Dead Reckoning Enabled, then Joe should continue to 
move on their maps too.  You can even enter his frequency in his
object text, so that others know what freq to contct him on.  
If joe stops for a rest stop, next time he mentions a milemark, 
just click and drag him to the new milemark, and his DR will be 
updated on everyone else's map too.

Without Dead Reckoining, the map display of an APRS client is 
always wrong.  It always shows where things were 1, 3, 5, 10, 
30 minuets ago, which is pretty useless in maintaining 
"situational awareness"!!!  Turn on DR going to Dayton!  
And USE MILE MARKS and objects to show us everyone else on the 
road in range, not just the APRS folks.  APRS was never desigend 
to be an end-in-itself, but to be a tool for ALL OF Amateur Radio.

PRELOAD OBJECTS INTO YOUR PM MEMORIES:

Pre-load your D700/710 with a few OBJECT names...  If you see a
situation of interest to your fellow travelers, you can send out
the OBJECT at your present location..  You would never use this
of course, to avoid a SMOKIE speed trap, but only to help fellow
motorists find a partially hidden policeman (or other object) in
time of need...

You can save up to 4 such objects in your other 4 PM's
temporarily.  The only requirements in those PM's are these:

  MYCALL = SLOW [or WRECK, TRAFFC, STUCK, LUNCH, DINNER, SMOKIE,
           DONUTS, POLICE, etc]
  STATUS = "de CCCCCC"  <= your call
  GPS ON   clearly you cannot use a fixed posit here...

And optionally set these items if available:
  PATH   = WIDE1-1 or more (though any path will do...)
  PKT TX = MANUAL, (but any existing one will do)

Notice that only the first three are required, and one status
can be re-used by any PM.  So for the Dayton travel weekend, you
can actually re-use any of your existing PM's by making only
those 2 changes, and then remembering to change them back after
the trip.

When you want to transmit an OBJECT, just switch to that PM,
press the BCON button a few times in the next 30 seconds until
you think you got out.  Do not keep sending it further down the
road, because you don't want it to follow you!  THEN switch back
to your regular traveling PM.  Enjoy!

COMMUNITY DIGIPEATER SUPPORT FOR TRAVELERS:
-------------------------------------------

ALL DIGIPEATER OWNERS:  Make sure your digitpeater has the proper 
settings for the New-N paradigm.  For details see:

                  http://aprs.org/fix14439.html

DIGIS IN DAYTON:  Turn off WIDEn-N support except for ONE HOP.  
This whould be able to support 150 APRS mobiles which is typial 
of APRS in Dayton.  TO do this (assuming you have set your digi 
for New-N above):

1) Set UITRACE to TEMP,30
2) Set UIDIGI ON WIDE1-1,WIDE2-2,WIDE3-3

This will cause these digipeaters to digipeat any/all mobiles 
ONE HOP no matter whether they are using 1, 2, or 3 hops.
This will prevent any outside QRM from coming in.

WATCH FOR RECEOMMENDED VOICE REPEATER FREQUENCEIS ON THE FRONT 
PANEL OF YOUR MOBILE APRS RADIO:  Many areas are supporting the 
"New Local Info Initiative" which transmits local-direct info 
on the recommended voice repeater in their area for direct 
display on the D7, D700 and HamHUD mobile Displays.  See:

                  http://aprs.org/localinfo.html

Hope I got everyting covered.  I'll be PASSENGER mobile this 
year and will be playing APRS all the way from Maryland to 
Dayton on Thursday night and Friday morning.
