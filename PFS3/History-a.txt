Some History From Jim White WD0E on 10/13/2017:
-----------------------------------------------
Amazing how once on the www things live forever.

This exchange was right after launch when we were having trouble getting the initial
software booted up and running.  Turns out the flash stored boot loader and initial
housekeeping software had become corrupted just before launch.  While we don't know for
sure we suspected that happened when we were doing last minute battery charging and
through operator error 'browned out' the processor repeatedly.

SpaceQuest (who built the avionics) was able to provide this snapshot using their boot
loaded / command software suite. Subsequent to this they were able to provide a modified
set of firmware we uploaded and as you can see from the dates FS3 has been operated for
over 10 years. Check the current uptime telemetry line. The first number is the days it
has been operating without interruption.
