Climat Stewards of Annapolis - Groups in the Solar Initiative (rev a)  16 Feb 2016
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a summary of groups that have received a solar panel from Climate Stewards
of Greater Annapolis and are using them to promote solar in scouting and youth 
programs or other projects:    See  http://aprs.org/camp-solar.html

* Annapolis Friends Meeting (1) - a solar powered church with one on display (and 
also is storing the extra panels until gone).

* Annapolis Green (1):  Has one on display at their Green Home/office on State 
Circle in Annapolis.

* Troop 883 near Winchester - Lee Garrison(2):  We have seen some very nice 
portable backpack systems for charging portable batteries. There are also many 
nice ideas for lighting and recharging stations. I have build Chuck boxes/ camp
kitchens for Troop 883 and lead classes for various merit badges.

* Severna Park Troop 993, Gary Tawes - is very interested possibly for our 
quartermaster and trailer...   We are looking at getting a few LED lanterns and 
battery/converter as described on your website

* Cape St Clair troop 995, Steve Gozzo (1) -  We'd like to work with this and 
create an easy to pack out and set up system.  I currently have several solar 
powered light I use camping with our troop.  We are always working to be self 
sustaining... it makes for interesting discussions and merit badge work for our 
scouts.

* DelMarVa, Ralph Churchill W3FME - I work with several scout camps and these 
solar panels are great opportunity to add solar power to our amateur radio 
program.

* Four Rivers District, Len Morgan - we'd like to put a panel on our District's 
scout trailer to provide ready power whenever the trailer is taken somewhere.

* Annapolis, Ryan Johnson (2) - I work with a number of troops now, 993 SPUMC, 
382 Asbury, 835 Ulmstead, 422 St. Mary’s, 396 Trinity UMC, and the one I wanted 
to use this for, Ernie Rodgers split off and is working with disadvantaged kids 
in a small troop 323 downtown at First Baptist.

* Southern Maryland, David Kanter(2) - Assistant Scout Master in SoMD's largest 
Troop.  I will move this on and they will hopefully share this with District!
