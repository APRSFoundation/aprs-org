FLIGHT INTERFACE BOARD ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES                   21 April 2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               PC2assy.txt
MUST DO:
  Final flight ROMS need XM levels set to nominal levels 280/40?
  Retest audio levels on PSK-31 receiver
  Figure out TXA Keying decay anomoly
  Test packet while in PSK mode
  Test packet while in RPTR mode
  Prior to flight DTR must be jumpered LOW

BUGS:  Connected LED only comes on if stream is |1A [***FIXED in ROM]
       But stream must be |2A for solar data        [***FIXED in ROM]
       CHECK must default to 48 (480 secs, 8 mins)  [***FIXED in ROM]
       AX25L2V2 OFF  This eliminates the CHECK packets and forces a timeout.
                                                    [***FIXED in ROM]
       UHF and VHF transmitters take different levels by a factor of 3.
           must add attenuator for UHF Transmitters.


Initial Part Assemblies:
  Piggyback 1n4148 diodes on 150K R13 and R17
  Install 11v zener at D27
  Install 10v Zener above C62

Board FLIGHT mods and work-arounds:
  96 hr timer: Cut trace under CD4040 chip & jump to pin 11 of second chip
  On TNCs, C45 needs to be one direction for TNC-A and opposite for TNC-B
  Fix: Cut two lands under RY2 and add jumper
  Fix Audio: Cut trace below RY21 and insert 10k 0.1W resistor 
  Fix AC coupling of DTMF diodes: D11,14,15,18 on wrong side of Caps.
     * Remove D18.  Reinstall anode and jumper cathode across R1A to via
     * Cut D14 cathode top trace and jumper to small via near "iD" and "A"
     * Cut D15 cathode top trace and jumper to small via near TBtxa
     * Cut D11 cathode bottom trace.  Jumper to big hole near pin 13
  Install: Insert R17/D17 backwards from silkscreen
  Install: INsert the two LED's backwards
  Install: Insert Fuse F13 "high" so it can be twisted out of the way of C12
  Install: Install 100 ohm vice 24K in the vicinity of the 555 timer
  Install: Install 220k vs 47k in the vicinity of the 555 timer
  Install: Install C22 backwards
  New: Install R49 and Q41 to add 48 hour alert on TNC temps
  New: Install R6X(20k) and R6Y(12k) to correct audio levels and bias
  Fix: Cut bottom horizontal trace to right of R65 and add C4 on top
  Fix: Add 5v zener Dz5 from right end of C4 to Ground
  New GSE ARM: Add diodes D1X,D1Y to pin 2 of TX/RX connector (TxcT)
  New GSE DTR: Install DTR header to pin 20 of both TNC DB-25's
  New: Install Rpm, Cpm and Dpm flight mods to mute PSK during packet
  New: Install jumper from RXa and RXb to 9600 bd TNC inputs (pin 2's)
          Also cut around land near R2C on bottom to be sure it is clear
  Install: Install DTMF programming jumper near Multiplexer
  Fix: Cut both port XCD lines to isolate the two TNCs.  Install diodes to
          drive from SOLAREX (C4) and from TNC PTT's.
  New: Current Sense for RX heaters. Cut isolate Q25 emitter. Run to F16

  Resistors R3J,3L,3K,3M are not used

Insert all Relays
  * Insert all Telemetry 1% resistors as shown on Telemetry Schematic

  * Insert all 1n4148 diodes (40)

  * Insert all 5% 0.1 Watt miniature resistors.  Part numbers RCR05C?102JS
    1.0 k  - R29
    3.3 k  - R69
     12 k  - Two small RS-232 pull-up resistors near DB-25
     47 k  - R1G,1H,1J,1K  all near the DTMF's

  * Insert all 5% 1/2 Watt Resistors
      8    - R2C
    100    - R64
    560    - R1A, R1B
    750    - R65
    1.0 k  - R26,R3E
    1.8 k  - R1.8K by 555 timer
    4.7 k  - R16,R2D,2E,2F,2H,60, RLED
     12 k  - R3,03,5,05,6,06,7,8,9,14,1C,1E,21,23,25,28,2B,Rc1,Rc2
     22 k  - R11,R12
     62 k  - R15,20,22,24,27
    150 k  - R13,R17 (see above), R2G,2J,2K,2L,2N,2P,2Q,2R

Capacitors:
     47uF  - Four white Dot caps near Relays (C1D, C1E, C1F, C1G)

Trims:
    Jumper the 555 220k with 3.3k and test for 22 minutes.  
               if so, then parallel with 2.2M for final.
    Trim exact XMTR frequencies with R61,62,63  0.1W resistors

Receiver board RXB needs trims on the squelch. Try 43k/56K
         it also needs volume set at 12k/82k
