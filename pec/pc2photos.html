<B>PCSAT2 
<A HREF="../pcsat2.html"> (see main page)</A> was retrieved from the outside of the ISS and returned to Earth in Sept 2006:</B>
On 20 October, the four midshipmen, Campbell, Dendinger, Lewis, and Lwyn and I visited NRL 
to conduct a post-flight functional test.  In the photo below, the powerful 4000 watt
Sun simulator lamp is out the door behind Dendinger.

For reference, these next two photos show the installation of MISSE5/PCSAT2
on the outside of the ISS in September 2005:

<B>Post Flight Functional Test:</B>  The remainder of these photos are of
the post-flight functional test in the clean room at NRL.  Since MISSE5 hardware
will fly again, it's disassembly is being done carefully and with care not to damage
any of the flight hardware which may be re-used.  This is the test stand
so that the solar panels could be illuminated by the 4000 Watt lamp:

Next is the configuration of our dual briefcase ground stations that were used for 
telemetry, command and control during the post-flight test.  The screen on the left
shows the USNA command screen and the one on the right is running Hyperterm to
capture the 9600 baud science data:

The next photo shows the PCSAT2 side of the system and if you look in the upper left
corner you will notice the missing VHF antenna that "broke off" in the astronauts hands
as he was manipulating it to fold it under the MLI blanket for return to Earth.
<P>
<IMG SRC="PC2sideX.JPG">
<P>
You can see where the antenna broke at the sharp double-90 degree bend that was a last
minute bend by the spacecraft integrators to assure the antenna would not abrade against
the main solar cells when it was in its folded launch configuration.  This double-90 
degree bend in the brittle berilium copper antenna assured a stress and fracture point 
susceptible to fatigue damage.
<P>

There was some visible damage to the solar arrays after 1 year on orbit and the following
photo shows the largest impact hit on one of the solar cells.
<P>
<IMG SRC="MeteorHitcloseX.JPG">

Two of our typical low cost (2-cents-on-the-dollar) solar cells were flown and only appear
slightly clouded after a  year in space.  This matches our experience after 5 years on
orbit of the same cells on PCSAT1 that appear to have lost only about 30% of their 
beginning-of-life performance over the 5 years.  The other commercial panel we flew
had clouded up 100% during ground testing even before flight and was useless.

<P>
Another interesting observation was the slight fogging of the Kapton tape on the tip of
the antenna as shown in the photo below.  The tip on the right is compared to a new
strip of the same tape (pressed onto the stainless steel table for comparison).  Also
note the absence of fogging on the main antenna Kapton Tape which is a special coated
version to better withstand the atomic oxygen on orbit.

can monitor the APRS worldwide Internet system and see it.
