------------------------------------------------------------------
 
- Recommended DUAL-Redundant design (see photo)  <pec/pecflatsat.jpg>
- TX power 2 Watts peak transmitting short few second data bursts 
- TX whole orbit packet duty cycle less than 10% 
- Peak solar power needed on single flat array = 20W 
- Solar array sample Telemetry < 2,000 bytes per pass (2% duty cycle/Pass) 
- Amateur Satellite UI digipeater mission (20% dutycyle over USA) 
- Data would use 9600 baud for Telemetry and 1200 baud for Transponder
