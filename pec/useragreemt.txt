----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             de WB4APR
Updated 26 Aug 2005   (Launch)
Updated 23 Oct 2005   (Added remote environmental and data sensors)
Updated  4 Dec 2005   (Added caution re: interferring with crew voice)
                      (and emphasis on mobile communications)
SERVICE:

PCSAT2 may be operated in a number of modes to serve the Amateur
Satellite Community.  Particularly, its goal is to facilitate contacts
with mobile stations.  Grade of service depends on user adherence 
to power levels, transmission period, modulation modes and 
precedence criteria and authorized modes only.

POLICY STATEMENT:

PCSAT2 is an open system in accordance with the ITU regulations for
the Amateur Satellite Service.  To provide the best overall through-
put for the largest collection of users, PCSAT2 transponders are 
protocol driven and require that all users adhere to the fundamental 
protocol requirements.  Users that adhere to these published protocol 
and operating standards are very welcome to use the transponders in 
accordance with the ITU rules.  Operations outside of these conditions 
are not authorized and will need to be approved on a case basis.
                                                                    
AGREEMENTS:

You may use PCSAT2 for your own communications and experimentation
if you adhere to the following agreements:

0) IF PCSAT2 is operating with a 145.825 downlink, it has the potential
   to occassionally block the crew from hearing uplinks if they are
   trying to make voice contacts.  For this reason, IF PCSAT2 is on
   145.825 downlink, then users are REQUIRED to verify that there is 
   no crew voice operations on 145.800 before using PCSAT2 digipeater.

1) PCSAT2 is for users and data applications.  It is NOT for UNATTENDED 
   beaconing of fixed text from fixed stations.  Unattended beacons 
   from fixed stations except for remote data or environmental sensors 
   at low rates are not authorized.

1b However, since the PCSAT series of satellites were designed for
   the purpose of promoting an Amateur Radio Satellite capability
   for mobiles, the unatteneded beaconing from a vehicle at a 5
   minute rate for the purpose of assessing success statistics is
   authorized. (new as of 4 Dec 2005)

2) The PCSAT2 packet transponder is for UI digipeating only.  No 
   CONNECTIONS either TO or THROUGH the packet system are normally
   authorized.  All transmissions are expected to have extremely low
   duty-cycles.

3) The PCSAT2 PSK-31 analog Transponder is for PSK-31 operations only
   but CW or other narrowband modes may be authorized when loading is 
   light.  SSB voice or other broadband signals are NOT authorized.
   When you hear the downlink on 435.275, you are welcome to use it!
   (This transponder is inop).

4) The use of the PCSAT2 crossband FM repeater is a backup for the
   Kenwood ARISS radio already on board.  Activation is not anticipated
   unless explicitly set up by ARISS for specific school purposes.

5) Keep informed of the current operating requirements via the PCSAT2
   and ARISS web pages and/or via bulletins in the downlink.  For
   Packet mode, the requested routine uplink rate is only 1 routine 
   position/status packet per 2 minutes (attended).  5 minutes if
   unattended mobile.  One-line messages may be somewhat more frequent 
   in a dialog context.  The BText from PCSAT2 will announce the 
   authorized routine rate for mobiles using  the syntax:  
           "OPS-Normal 2m rate...." etc.

6) Understand that the PCSAT2 PACKET mission and your objective is 
   to get your position, message, status or other data or sensor 
   telemetry digipeated once or so per pass footprint. Share the 
   resource.  Minimize your transmissions..

7) The PCSAT2's digipeater uses the same aliases as ARISS: VIA ARISS
   Like the terrestrial network, PCSAT2 does callsign-substitution 
   of its own MYCALL to indicate that it has digipeated the packet. 
   Other aliases are WIDE and APRSAT as well as WIDE2-2.

8) Use only the authorized power levels, channel and periodicity for 
   your station class and precedence as posted and published below.
   These are the routine default packet transmission rates:

   STATION CLASS     PWR  BAUD  UPLINK   PERIOD   DIGIPATH  DOWNLINK*
   ----------------  ---  ----  -------  -------  --------  ---------
   Mobile (attended) 50W  1200  145.825  2 mins   APRSAT    435.275
   Mobile (parked)   50W  1200  145.825  5 mins   APRSAT    435.275
   Handi-Talkie       5W  1200  145.825  1 min    APRSAT    435.275

   * Sometimes the dowlink may be on 145.825 in which case, unattended
   operation is not authorized unless effort is made to assure the
   crew is not using 145.800 for voice.

9) Use the shortest possible packets.  Mic-E protocol, Grid Square or
   APRS compressed are preferred (typically 30 bytes or so).  ALso
   Use a short TX Delay (TXD) of about 150ms  or less if possible.

10) Determine your own precedence based on your current communications 
   requirements for each pass.  In general, all use is routine except 
   for special circumstances.  SPECIAL usage is for students, schools, 
   demonstrations, and long term events.  PRIORITY usage may 
   be for VIP demos or special one-time events.  Use good judgment, 
   being fair to all other usrs.  To alert other users of any SPECIAL
   or PRIORITY operations, be sure to include a note in your packets.

SAFE MODE:  Whenever PCSAT2 RESETS to "safe mode" all transmissions will
cease.  Do not continue to transmit until you again hear activity on the
downlink.

ACCEPTANCE:

If you accept the conditions of operation via PCSAT2, please sign this 
document and post it in your Amateur Satellite Operating station.
Enjoy PCSAT2!  It will only last a year before the equipment is returned
to earth.
