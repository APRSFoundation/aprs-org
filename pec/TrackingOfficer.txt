PCSAT2 Tracking Officer                                 25 July 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The tracking officer is responsible for all spacecraft tracking and
antenna pointing during a pass.  The beamwidth of our antennas is 
on the order of 30 degrees or so and so precision requirements are
not that great.  Here are the detail responsibilities:

1) Check all PC's and the MISSION clock to make sure all are sync'ed
to correct time (within a few seconds).

2) Download the latest KEPS from: http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/
   Get the amateur radio file and copy it to a floppy disk:

   http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/amateur.txt

3) Place the disk in the main tracking laptop and in InstantTrack
software do these commands:

   Q - as needed to quit back to main menu
   6 - Houskeeping
       A -  Update Satellite Elements
            3 - UPDATE:
                enter A:amateur.txt
       Q as needed back to main menu
   2 - Real-time track
       3 - ISS

4)  Compare the position of ISS on the tracking computer
to that on this web page:  http://heavens-above.com/
and also compare to the backup tracking computer and confirm
that the predicted position is no more than 5 degrees off
in LAT and Long from those backups.

5)  Make an entry in the log book recording your update.
