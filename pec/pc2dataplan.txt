PCSAT2 SOLAR EXPERIMENT DATA COLLECTION                     7 Jan 2003
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A complete data set consists of 49 lines of ASCII text data.  There
are two methods to aquire this data on the ground:

   Continuous beacon mode
   Command dump

BEACON MODE:  The SOLAR-EX will send over the RS-232 serial port lines 
to the TNC for immediate transmission 7 ASCII lines of data once every 
30 seconds or so and it takes 7 such transmissions to constitute a 
complete data set.  These transmissions will occur continuously when 
there is sufficient power and thermal conditions are within range.

To receive this data, there will be at least two ground stations and
as many others as may volunteer.  These two stations will track PCSAT2
on all passes and feed the data live via telnet connection to the
global APRS system.  Typically these reflectors carry that stream:

   first.aprs.net
   second.aprs.net
   third.aprs.net

NRL, NASA GLEN and USNA will run the program called ALOGGER which will
remain loged on to the above sites and capture all packets originated
by PCSAT2 when over any ground station.  Every such packet will be 
saved to a daily file.   ALOGGER can be downloaded from the site:
http://www.wa6oft.com/dnld.htm  The current version is ALOGGER15.zip.

COMMAND MODE:  In addition, during passes over USNA, PCSAT2 can be 
commanded during live operations, to dump a complete data set on the
downlink.  Each dump will take about 10 seconds or less and the data
will be captured to file for forwarding to NRL.  THis command dump
can only be made using the secure command link.  

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

To implement this system on PCSAT2, the following steps are involevd:

1) PCSAT2 TNC's must be modified to have a "IGNORE SERIAL PORT"
   command.  This is so that we can command the BEACON mode OFF,
   and/or disable the SOLAREX if it locks up in a continuous send
   mode.  Note, it is much easier if a "DONT-SEND" command was
   implemented in the NASA/Glen SOLAREX CPU...

2) SOLAREX must have a command parser to accept a serial port
   command to initiate the command dump.

3) USNA, and NASA/Glen need to download one of the APRS programs to do
   the live feed of beacons to the TELNET feed.

4) USNA, NASA/Glen, USNA need to download and run ALOGGER.  For
   practice/verification, ALOGGER can be run now and be set for PCSAT
   so that experience can be gained in capturing data files.
