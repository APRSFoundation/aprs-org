PCSAT2 INTERFACE BOARD ASSEMBLY PLAN                            13 May 2003
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


The board began burn-in testing at 1800 on 30 April 2003 and completed
254 hours at 1500 on 12 May.  The board is ready for conformal coating.
There are only 3 trim resistors that will be adjusted after final assembly
and test.  These are R61, R62 and R63 in the middle of the board which
set the final transmitter frequencies.

MOUNT DTMF DECODERS:

Mount the two DTMF decoders in semi-permanent manner.  Notice, they have
an edge connector and if they need last minute re-programming, they
have to be removed and re-programmed.

MASKING PLAN:

1) Mask all DB connectors 
2) Mask the four corner mounting holes 
3) Mask the area around the 3 resistors R61, R62, R63
4) Mask the three 3-pin configuration jumper headers.
5) Stake any tall components, and chips in sockets.

CONFORMAL COAT

ASSEMBLE

1) Plug TNC-A into the edge connectors on the Intereface board.  THis is a 
stressful process and once done, these two boards may be treated as a unit.

2) Mount TNC-B onto TNC-A, plug in its three connectors, and solidify the
stack with the two stand-off's.  Now these 3 boards are typically treated
as a unit.

3) Assemble in TNC box to check the fit. NOTICE:  The screws attaching the
DB-25 edge connector to the TNC-BOX sidewall must impart no stresses on the
Interface board PCB.  ANd the mechanical clamping of the TNC's in the  box
should also impart no aditional stresses on the PCB or its connectors.

FINAL-TEST/TRIM:

The Transmitters inside the TX BOX, the receivers inside the RX box and
the TNC box are needed together to establish the final values of the 3
resistors.  The TNC box will be disassembled to solder in those final
values and then reassembled for flight.
