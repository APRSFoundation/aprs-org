The purpose of this specification was to detail the firmware/software
requirements needed on ECHO to fully support mobile and handheld 
digital communications using the Kenwood and other APRS data radios.  
Kenwood specifically recalled and re-released the TH-D7(G) model just
so that it would be compatible with Mode J Satellite Digipeating!

The specification below was provided to help make sure that ECHO was 
compatible  with this potential for handheld satellite digital 
communicators.  The items are listed from the most important and 
significant down through the nice-to-have items:

REQUIRED:
  1) Enable UI digipeating in the digital modes when possible.

SHOULD HAVE:
  2) Support digipeating aliases of WIDE, APRSAT and ARISS and optionally
     the additional paths of WIDE1-1 and WIDE2-2 and possibly WIDE3-3.
  3) To prevent uninformed users to attempt wasteful end-to-end AX.25 
     "connections", change the code to be sure that ONLY "UI" packets 
     are digipeated and not any other packets (ie CONNECT REQUESTS & ACKS).

SUPPORTING CHANGES:
  4) Do callsign substitution on the above four aliases such that the
     digipeated packet contains ECHO's callsign instead of the alias.
  5) Add a 200 ms delay before UI packets are inserted in downlink.
  6) Add a 1 minute 20-28 byte UI APRS formatted STATUS packet in the downlink
  7) The AX.25 TOCALL for status must be TO BEACON or ALL or QST or APxxxx
     in order to be seen on an APRS radio
  

ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL CHANGES:
  8) Provide memory buffers for up to four 64 character BULLETINS.  The
     ECHO team can update these bulletins as needed to inform users of
     things going on.  These will be seen on the front panel of mobile
     users monitoring the downlink with D7 or D700 radios. 
  
NICE TO HAVE ITEMS:
  9) Operate the downlink on 435.275 which is the same downlink frequency
     of PCSAT2 which will also be in orbit at the same time.  This lets
     the same IGates serve both PCSAT2 and ECHO.  And lets us operate
     a UI Digipeating satellite constellation of TWO birds.

     Or operate on PCSAT's alternate 9600 baud downlink on 437.975.
 
 10) Operate the UI digipeating uplink on 145.825 which is the same as
     PCSAT2.  Since APRS uses generic digipeating callsigns, remote
     travelers wouldnt need to change anything to operate whatever bird
     is in view at any time.  The constellation of 2 birds works transparently.

JUSTIFICATION:  These changes will permit ECHO to serve not only as a 
bent-pipe transponder between handheld and mobile data transceiver users 
themselves and the internet, but also for ECHO to report its status 
and some bulletins to all users on the radio's front panel.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

ECHO STATUS and BULLETINS to MOBILES:

Kenwoods HT's have a 3 line by 10 character STATUS display screen
and this same 3 line by 10 characters is flashed on the front panel
of the mobile D700 when a new STATUS is received.  Further, the
HT has a 5 line by 12 character display screen arranged on two pages
for up to 10 Bulletins.  ECHO can hit these displays direct.  We want 
ECHO status and Bulletins to be viewable by these mobiles and HT's.

The status and bulletin traffic looks much better if the 
line-wraps are considered in the display formats of Bulletins and 
Status.  Bulletins will be formatted by the SYSOPS on the ground 
prior to uplink to the Bulletin buffers, but the ECHO 20 or 28 
character status text should be formatted to look nice on the two 
line display as follows.  In these examples, the AX.25 packet is shown 
in the typical TAPR-2 standard header format:

APRS STATUS FORMAT:  
-------------------

RAW PACKET:    ECHO-1>QST:>xxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyzzzzzzzz
                        Begins with ">" and 28 characters follow
                     
DISPLAY on D7:    FLASHED on D700:   SAVED on D700:

+--------------+  +--------------+   +--------------------------------+
| ECHO-1:      |  | ECHO-1:      |   | ECHO-1:                        |
|   xxxxxxxxxx |  |   xxxxxxxxxx |   |   xxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyzzzzzzzz |
|   yyyyyyyyyy |  |   yyyyyyyyyy |   +--------------------------------+
+--------------+  +--------------+

The last 8 characters are lost on the D7 and not flashed on the D700.
But when the display is called up again on the D700, the full 28 are
available.  Thus, the first 20 bytes are seen by everyone, so the last
8 should be less important optional information.

For example, this typical UO-22 status packet is not well formatted for
quick human consumption:

UOSAT5>STATUS:Fri Jan 28 01:48:46 2000 Up: 23/17:11 EDAC= 88 
              F:147696 L:146688 d:1 [0].

The objective is to make the 20 characters of status the most useful
to casual viewers of the bird.  Maybe something like:

+--------------+     +--------------------------------+
| ECHO-1:      |     | ECHO-1:                        |
|   FM Voice / |     |   FM VOICE /PSKenabled on Lbnd |
|   PSKenabled |     +--------------------------------+
+--------------+

The trick being to understand what ECHO status is most important to
these mobile and HT users and to figure out the best arrangement of the 
20 (or 28) characters to be most human readable...

BULLETIN FORMAT
---------------

Although the Kenwood can receive and save up to 10 BULLETINS, these 
also compete with personal messages to the same users, so in general
users do not like to see BULLETIN SPAM.  But they do like to see
what is going on.  So, although I recommended a 4 Bulletin buffer
capability in ECHO, in general, they are not all four needed to be
on all the time.  The AX.25 APRS format for a Bulletin is as follows:

ECHO-1>QST::BLN1ECHO :This is a bulletin text up to 64 bytes long.
ECHO-1>QST::BLN2ECHO :The 64 count begins with the word "The" in this line.
ECHO-1>QST::BLN3ECHO :The BLN# is requied by the APRS format.  The ECHO is optional.
ECHO-1>QST::BLN4ECHO :Notice the packet data begins with a :xxxxxxxxx: field.

The :xxxxxxxxx: is a 9 byte fixed length TOFIELD which is used for APRS messages.
In this case, the message is TO the callsign of BLN#ECHO which identifies it as
a bulletin to all users on frequency, with a sequential number, and then an
optional bulletin group (ECHO).  Notice that it has to be padded to the full 9
byte length with an extra SPACE character to match the APRS 9 byte call field.

On the D7 the bulletin is read as 4 lines of 12 bytes each on 2 pages.
On the D700, the bulletin is read as 3 lines of 22,22,21 bytes in length.
But since these bulletins will be composed and  uploaded from the ground, there
is no need to worry about the detailed word-wrap formatting here.  Just make
sure it begins with the :BLN#ECHO : APRS header and it will work...
