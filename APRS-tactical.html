<P> . APRS is billed as a situational awareness service, 
<BR> . yet the map is largely barren of situational 
<BR> . awareness information.  I ask myself "why?"

Good question!...  In the middle years as APRS grew in user size, it seemed to
deminish evey year from its original intent as a tactical real time
information resource and fast 2-way communications system to nothing but
a vehicle tracking system in many people's eyes.  Its time to re-open their eyes!
This page suggests some ideas why users have this misconception:

APRS is not about <i>vehicle tracking</i>.  It is a single <B>information resource</B> channel 
where everything that is going on in ham radio in the surrounding area can be
announced and updated in real time.  It presents to the viewer on his 
APRS radio front panel <i> all that is happening</i>
right now, where it is, and all the info he needs to participate whether it is an event,
happening, net, activity, announcement, future activity, or situation.  The APRS channel
is his one-stop
look at everything that could be going on in the local area, 
and his one-stop place to post what he might be doing that might be of interest to others.

APRS is not about GPS positions, it is about a situational map display of everything that
is happening, and most of that is OBJECTS containing INFO on the activty and how to 
contact other operators.  Here are some local info examples to the mobile: 
<P>

<P>
These objects inform visitors or travelers (from left to right), the locally recommended 
voice repeater, its tone and approximate range.  Other eobjects can announce
the local Echolink and IRLP nodes and other info of
local interest to help the traveler join in on local operations.  In the D710 mobile radio, these
nearby objects can be sorted by distance, type, alphabetically, and time.  See
the <A HREF="localinfo.html"><B>APRS Local Info</B></A> web page for details.
<P>
APRS is not about dumb-one-way-trackers.  APRS was designed for the manual
and automatic 
entry and management of large numbers of on-screen objects that would be a major 
function of the display of local information. . Further, Bulletins and
Announcements would keep everyone informed of the SAME
information at the SAME time. . Operator Messages would communicate
important information in the background without encumbering voice nets.
<A HREF="aprs-messaging.html"><B>See Messaging</B></A>.  And finally, that
all mobiles would have simple displays to keep them in communicaitons and
aware of their surroundings.  These images below show an APRS message (in this case transmitting an email):

<B>MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT APRS:</B> 
<BR> The following misconceptions may be what is keeping some amateur radio operators
from using APRS to its full potential:</B>
<P>

<LI> Misconception that <B>P</B> stands for <B>P</B>osition <i>transmission</i> 
     instead of <B>PACKET</B> <i>reception</i>.
<LI> Misconception that APRS is just a Vehicle Tracking System instead of a
     <B>Real-Time Information Distribution System</B>.
<LI> Please read the APRS <A HREF="TrackerManifesto.html"><B>Tracker Manifesto </B></A> to use trackers responsibly.

<LI> Misconception that APRS is dependent on GPS for its value <B>(It is not. See Objects)</B>.

<LI> Failure to use the APRS built-in <B>Mile-Marks</B> for tracking all other non-APRS non-GPS mobiles.

<LI> Using APRS clients that only focus on maps and vehicles and ignored
     <A HREF="txt/fundamental-issues.txt"><B>too many of the APRS NETWORK fundamentals</B></A>.

<LI> Using Clients that ignored the fundamental 
     <A HREF="txt/operationsStationRate.txt"><B>Decay Algorithm</B></A> 
     to accelerate new data, and decay old data for channel speed and efficiency.

<LI> Failure to understand that APRS is all about OBJECTS: . See 
     <A HREF="txt/objects101.txt"><B>Objects 101</B></A>.

<LI> Failure to use real-time messaging: . See 
     <A HREF="txt/messages101.txt"><B>Messages 101</B></A> and 
     <A HREF="txt/messageRules.txt"><B>Message Operations</B></A>

<LI> Failure to implement the original APRS Centralized 
     <A HREF="txt/bulletinBoard.txt"><B>Common Bulletin Board</B></A> concept.

<LI> Failure to understand that the APRS operator is primarily a 
     <A HREF="txt/operators-displays.txt"><B><i> Data Input</i></B></A> 
     station <B>(See Objects, Bulletins and Messages)</B>

<LI> Failure to recognize that the D7, D700 and FTM-350 make exellent 
     <A HREF="aprsevent.html"><B><i> data entry and clipboard display units</i></B></A>
     at any field event. 

<LI> Failure to understand how to best use APRS  
     <A HREF="txt/operators-displays.txt"><B> Displays </B></A> 
     in support of real-time events.</B>

<LI> Failure to display APRS 
     <A HREF="symbols.html"><B>symbols with all their attributes </B></A>
     visible to all viewers not just those that click on them.

<LI> Failure to manage the local APRS network by 
     <A HREF="event/event-digis.txt"><B> adjusting the local digipeater</B></A> 
     for the situation at hand.

<LI> Not realizing that 
     <A HREF="localinfo.html"><B> Voice Operating frequencies</B></A> 
     are as important as any other parameter in APRS.

<LI> No one in your area is running any of the APRS Satellite engines 
such as APRSdata or DIGI_NED that 
     send out minute-by-minute location info on any AMSATs that are in 
     view.  These satellite objects show up on the front panel of the
     radio by name, with the present uplink and downlink frequencies
     and present doppler so all you need do is press a button and
     your radio can tune to the satellite in real time.  See
     <A HREF="http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/astars.html"><B>Satellite Bulletins and Objects</B></A>
     about 60% down the ASTARS page.  You don't need any satellite tracking program.
     The info comes in on your APRS radio display. (but we do need someone to update
     this 10 year old program to run under Windows).
<P>
<B>APRS POWERPOINT:</B> If you want to see my emphasis on APRS, you can review
<A HREF="APRS-by-Bob-l.ppt"><B>this power point presentation</B></A>. . Though, without my 
words and emphasis, the full flavor of APRS as a real-time information system
(not just vehicle tracking) may not come across quite as strongly as I can make it.
<P>

<B>Typical Station:</B>
The photo below shows a typical APRS set up in the field at an event.  
. This station can be used to not only show other personnel at the checkpoint
the tactical situation, but it keeps the APRS operator at this site informed... 
It does this while not requiring his immediate and constant attention except when he needs
access to the info.  His laptop has been doing the radio monitoring <i> for him</i>
so that he does not need to keep his ear tuned to all the chatter on the voice net.
.  If he needs up-to-date info, he does not have to request it from the voice net, 
but just views the latest on his APRS displays when <i>he</i> needs it.
<P>


<B> ALL Information:</B>
In otherwords, the information on APRS is not just the location of vehicles, 
but all announcements, bulletins, messages, status, lists of info, 
locations of assets and personnel and objects, References, phone numbers, 
links, tables, whatever...  
If it has anything to do with the event, it should be on APRS, updated in real time,
and available to all on demand.

<IMG SRC="event/EOC-field-ei7ig.JPG" height=150 width=220 align=right>

<P>
<B>Other Data Entry Stations:</B> But we should not lose sight of the home 
station that can also be used as a great information resource.
The next photo shows a station that was set up in a motel room and the operators 
there could monitor 
all of the activities on the various nets and enter this situational information
into their APRS PC's and all this data would show everywhere on APRS. . AND
through the miracle of wireless (ham radio) they do not have to be at the
site.  . They do NOT need GPS and they can be anywhere convenient, just monitoring, 
and inputing and managing the data (that appears everywhere).

<P>
<B>REMEMBER:</B> If you are not using the full potential of APRS, it is not the
fault of the protocol or the hardware.  . APRS is a communication tool, not just
an automated map. . Use it.  But in most cases, that means ENTERING DATA, not
just watching it.  Also, even if you do not use APRS personally, make sure that your
local area, club or organization does support a packet digipeater on 144.39 for
those travelers that do transit your area.  They depend on you for their connectivity,
and <A HREF="localinfo.html">local info</A>, and may join your
activities.  The map below from Hessu, OH7LZB's web site 
<A HREF="http://aprs.fi/"><B>http://aprs.fi/</B></A> 
shows a one month snapshot of activity.  Look to see that
your area is supporting these travelers.

<B>UNIVERSAL Amateur Radio MESSAGES and CONTACT System:</B> All radio amateurs should 
realize that 
they can use APRS to communicate to any other amateur radio operator at ANYTIME, ANYWHERE
using almost any DEVICE by using any of the 
<A HREF="aprs-messaging.html"><B>devices or techniques listed here.</B></A>
