ANDE Integration Functional Test Procedures:               14 March 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This revision includes updates from the pre-thermal tests on 14 March 
2006.  The base document used then was from the 22 July 05 pre-vib 
functional test.

This procedure is for functional testing of the ANDE comms modules using
a combination of GSE connected to the test harness and an RF receive 
station to functional test all aspects of both Comm Modules.

EQUIPMENT: 
   ANDE Comm Test Set with cross connect cable assembly
   Bench Power supply for 14.4 volts at 1.2 amp
   Telemetry Sensor Simulator Plug assembly
   Laser Load Resistor Simulator
   GSE Laptop connected to test set
   GSE RF briefcase with laptop and transceiver.

SETUP PROCEDURE:
----------------

0) Boot both PC's, cancel any windows logon window.
1) Run USNA002.exe on both PC's.  Use password "lmur" ENTER, hit ENTER.
2) Configure for ANDE with alt-S-USAGE-ANDE to see ANDE screen.
3) Plug the test set Power-A plug into left side connector on module
   COMM-01 and Power-B into the left side connector on COMM-02.
4) Plug the test set DB-9 Serial port into the GSE Laptop.
5) Plug TELM Simulator cables A and B into right side connectors.
6) Set power supply to 14.4 volts, set current limit knobs to about 1.5
   amps (which is about the 12:00 oclock position)
7) Turn all switches on the Test Set to off (down).  
8) Plug the Red and  Black leads into the power supply.
9) On RF station, turn radio on and set to 145.825, memory (MR 0).
10) Turn on RF power meter to switch position factor "1".
11) Turn on speaker volume control and connect to Test set.
12) Connect RF wattmeter to COMM-01 module RF connector.
13) Connect dummy load (2 attenuators) to RF connector on COMM-02.
14) If lasers are used, connect TELM B pigtails to Lasers, yellow wire
    to pin at 2 o'clock position and gray to pin at 4 o'clock position.
15) If lasers not used, connect one pigtail (2 wires) to the laser-test-load.
    There are two pigtails in case there are two laser assemblies to test
    at the same time.  But both are in parallel, so only one is needed
    when the laser-test-resistor simulator is used.  Be sure to prevent
    the unused pigtail from touching ground.

SOFTWARE AND MODES BACKGROUND:
------------------------------

USNA SOFTWARE can be in 2 modes:  TELEMETRY screen and KEYBOARD screen.
The KEYBOARD screen is used to send commands out the serial port to
either an attached TNC/radio (RF station) or to the spacecraft TNC
via a serial port connection.  All serial data is viewable on this
screen in raw form.  But you must be on the TELEMETRY screen to actually
receive and parse any telemetry data.  Use these transitions:

  C C ENTER will transition from TELEMETRY to the KEYBOARD screen 
            *AND* will also send a ^C to place a TNC into cmd: mode.

  K         will transition from TELEMETRY to KEYBOARD screen directly
            without going to cmd: mode.  Any typing in this mode will
            pass transparently through the TNC and be transmitted.
            Hitting a ^C here can get you from converse to cmd: mode.

  ESC       ESC will transition from the KEYBOARD screen to TELEMETRY.

A TERMINAL NODE CONTROLLER (TNC) can be in two modes, cmd: and CONVERSE.
The cmd: mode is for setting up or commanding the TNC parameters.  The
CONVERSE mode places the TNC in transparent mode so that anything typed
is transmitted by the TNC to an attached radio.

  Use "K ENTER"   as a command to go from cmd: to CONVERSE.   
  Use ^C to break from CONVERSE mode and go to cmd:  mode.
  
You will frequently transition between all these modes.  So these detail
transition entries may not be listed in each step in these procedures 
but are assumed to be an operator skill.

SCREEN CLEAR:  Sometimes it is desireable to clear the telemetry screen
to make new valuse more apparent.  Use the FILE-NEW command to do this.

DELAYS:  There are delays in the handshaking RF command modes becuase of 
the line-by-line protocol overhead.  Several seconds may be required.  
Further due to shared resources on the ANDE systems, there can be as 
much as a 10 second delay in response to some commands via the GSE port.


PREPARATION PROCEDURES:
-----------------------

While watching the current load on the Power Supply perform these steps:

Turn on Battery 1 switch.             Verify =< 0.01 A on power supply.
Turn on Sep-Switch.                   Verify =< 0.01 Amp .
Turn on the RX-A wake switch.         Verify about 0.07 Amp or less
Set speaker switch DOWN (A).          Verify radio noise in speaker
Wait 15 secs.                         Verify 1 sec TX burst >= 0.50 Amps
Turn on Battery 3 switch (B1).
Set speaker switch UP (B) (on back)   Verify no noise (RX-B is off)
Turn on Receiver B Wake switch.       Verify .12 Amps and speaker noise
Wait 15 secs.                         Verify 1 sec TX burst >= 0.50 Amps

Turn off both of the RX WAKE switches.  
Wait 1 minute for RX's to sleep shown by current =< .01 Amps.
If all OK to this point, it is safe to proceed with the test.

SIDE B TEST:
------------

Flip all battery switches, and the SEP switch up.  This will be the 
post-separation deployed configuration.

Set speaker switch to A side (down)
Flip the RX A WAKE switch up to wake up the side A system. 
Set the PC switch to the A side (down) and, execute these commands:
   C C        Hit C then C then ENTER to enter TNC command mode.
   ENTER      Hit ENTER to verify you get cmd mode.  (may take 10 s)
   TE 1       to set telemetry to every 10 secs
   ESC key    to get back to telemetry monitoring screen

After 40 seconds, on the RF station verify telemetry fields for the 
A side are updated.  Note, the GSE laptop cannot show Side A telemetry.
 
              A                         A1     A2     B1     B2
   VOLTS    13.5           Currents A:  35     38      -      -  mA
   X-SOL     .94           Currents B:   -      -      -      -  mA
   Y-SOL     .98           Volts:       .2 V  
   Z-SOL     .92           Use counter:       _____   
   5-volts   5.02          Temperatures:  all ambient

If side B wakes up too, then you will see its values as well.  
Set speaker switch to B side (up).
Wake up system B with the RX B WAKE switch. 
Flip the PC switch to B side (up) and do the C C ENTER to cmd: mode.
Send these commands: TE 1, MXM ON and MON ON following each by ENTER
After 40 seconds you should see side B on the RF systems screen:

              A      B                  A1     A2     B1     B2
   VOLTS    13.5   13.3    Currents A:  35     38     30     30  mA
   X-SOL     .94    .92    Currents B:  35     38     30     30  mA
   Y-SOL     .98    .98    Volts:       .2 V  
   Z-SOL     .92    .92    Use counter:       _____   
   5-volts   5.02          Temperatures:  all ambient

The B side telemetry will also show on the GSE laptop if the PC switch
remains in the B position.  A side telemetry cannot be viewed with this
wired GSE PC in this test.

To test the A side SOLAR sensors, momentarily hold the yellow clip lead on 
the Telemetry connector to the negative terminal of a 1.5 volt flashlight
cell for more than 40 seconds.  Verify Solar Cell voltages drop from their
.9 values to near zero (zero shows as black or no value) for that
telemetry system

Remove yellow clip lead and 1.5 volt cell.  It is OK for the yellow clip
to fall to ground.  No damage will occur.

Still with PC switch set on side B
 Send LEDS ON   Verify nothing happens
 Send CTR A ON  Verify LASER LED located on side B connector comes on. 
                Verify A1/A2 battery currents sum >= 500 mA
 Send CTR B ON  Verify currents shift mostly to B2 and B1/B2 >= 450 mA
 Send CTR A OFF Verify currents shift mostly to B1 and B1/B2 >= 450 mA
 Send LEDS OFF  Verify laser LED goes off.  Current drops to =< 0.13A.

 Send LEDS ON.     Verify laser LED comes ON.   Allow the receivers to
      return to sleep mode by turning off both RXA and RXB wake switches.
 Verify laser LEDS OFF and power drops to =< 0.01 amps within a minute 
      or so to simulate fail safe at LOS.

Verify RX-A wakes up 2 secs every 16 @ 25C. (A on longer when colder)
Verify RX-B wakes up 2 secs every 23 seconds (observe .06 on P.S.).

After the tests have been running for a while and MON has been on, 
confirm these bulletins have been received.  Press "A" or "B" to show
the bulletins received from the A or B side of ANDE.

After  15 seconds verify receipt of the first Bulletin
After  1 min 45 seconds verify receipt of second Bulletin
After  4 min 15 seconds verify receipt of third Bulletin
After 10 min 30 seconds verify receipt of fourth Bulletin


SIDE A TEST PROCEDURES:
-----------------------

SWAP the TELM A & B simulator cable end-for-end between A and B.  This
only does one thing, and that is to allow the yellow clip lead to be
used to test the side B solar sensor circuits.  The A end also has
real thermisters, whereas the end marked B only has fixed resistors
simulating thermisters.

Switch on both the A and B side receivers.
Switch the laptop PC switch to side B (up).  Hit ESC to TELEMETRY.
   C C ENTER and set TE 1, MXM ON and MON ON commands (ENTER after each)
Switch the laptop PC switch and speaker switch to side A (down).
   C C ENTER (or ^C) and set TE 1.
Wait for full telmetry from both sides on the RF station.

Connect the yellow clip lead on the Telemetry Simulator connector to 
the negative end of a 1.5 volt flashlight cell.  Hold the Plus terminal to
ground for over 40 secs until the simulated solar voltages appear.  THe
values should drop from the 0.9 range to the 0 range (or turn black-
blank) indicating full sun. (This is due to the inverted polarity of the
solar cells.).

Disconnect Yellow Clip Lead and battery.

Send CTR A ON.  Verify transmitter comes on and voice module wakes.
                Verify A2 battery current >= 400 mA for the duration 
                       of the voice announcement and returns to 0.16 A.
Send LEDS ON    Verify test set laser LED comes on.  A1/A2 sum >= 500 mA.
Send CTR B ON   Verify current shifts to mostly B2 and B1/B2 >= 500 mA
Send CTR A OFF  Verify current shifts mostly to B1 and B1/B2 >= 500 mA

Send LEDS OFF.  Verify laser LED off, currents back to =< .16 Amps.

Send LEDS ON.   Verify laser LED comes ON.   Allow the receivers to
     return to sleep mode by turning off the RXA and RXB test switchs.
Verify laser LEDS OFF and power drops below 0.01 amps
     within a minute or so to simulate fail safe at LOS.

VOICE TEST:
-----------

Set RX-A wake switch to ON.
With PC switch selecting side A, hit ESC and send these commands:
     C C ENTER        to get to cmd: mode
     MYAPRS TALK      to define the speaking callsign
     CTR OFF          to make sure of default state.

Send CTR A ON.    Verify transmitter comes on and voice module wakes.
                  Verify A2 battery current >= 400mA on PS for duration 
                  of the voice message and stops.  Current =< 0.16 A.

On RF station, tune TX channel to 145.825 (MR 0).
On RF laptop, hit ESC to go to TELEMETRY screen.  Then C C ENTER to cmd:
   so you can send the radio TNC the following commands:

   U APRS V ARISS  <ENTER>      This sets the proper callsign for voice
   K ENTER                      To get to keyboard mode (not cmd: mode).
   :TALK.....:testing <ENTER>   Notice that the 5 dots..... are SPACES
   :TALK.....:type anything here to be spoken, etc

Verify ANDE speaks each test.  Note, there may be 10 second delays in 
the voice even though the packet may be digipeated immediately.

TURN OFF VOICE MODULE:  On GSE Labtop, hit ESC and then enter:
   C C ENTER   To get to ANDE side A cmd: prompt.
   CTR OFF     To turn off voice module.  Notice that this turns off
               both the CTR A and CTR B circuits with one command.

END OF TEST:    Shut down as follows:
- Turn off all test set switches starting right to left.  
- Unplug red wire from power supply, turn Power supply off.
- Turn off the small battery powered Speaker box
- Turn the RF wattmeter switch to OFF.
- Exit USNA002.EXE with the FILE-QUIT-YES command.
- Disconnect connections if needed.
