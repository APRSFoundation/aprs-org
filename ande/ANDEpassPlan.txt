ANDE MAA OPERATIONS AND PASS PLAN                        05 Feb 2006
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To conserve primary battery power, the ANDE MAA comm system operates
predominantly in sleep mode, only waking one second out of every 16,
to check for a ground station or users.  Even when it passes over the
USA or Europe this low sampling rate may be missed and no wake-up
occurs.  THus no telemetry over ground stations.

TO get good telemetry from ANDE-MAA, the ground station needs to
transmit packets once per second for up to 16 seconds to wake ANDE 
and then logon to both the A and B sides and change the default 
telemetry rate from once every minute to once every 10 seconds.  THis
high rate data is necessary to get good sampling of attitude using
the onboard solar detectors.

OPERATIONS PASS PLAN:  The following procedures are suggested:

RADIO SETUP:  On the radio, press the left of the two volum control
knobs in the lower right corner to select the LEFT side of the radio.
On the left of the screen, press the MR key to select memory channels.  
Use the tuning knob to tune in memory channel 6 which will display as
145.825 and will also display a little combined +/- symbol showing
this is set for SPLIT operation.  Momentarily key the microphone and
observe that the TX frequency changes to 144.47 MHz.  This is the 
proper operation for ANDE side B.   Usually we like to use side B 
first.   Confirm the volume knob is set to about half volume.

LAPTOP SETUP:  The data from the radio modem goes to ALOGGER and also
to the Laptop.  On the laptop, use the alt-S-USAGE-ANDE command to 
select ANDE and then it should be on the ANDE telemetry screen.  The 
SPACE bar can refresh this screen.    The LAPTOP can be in two modes, 
the TELEMETRY GRAPHICS SCREEN, or the KEYBOARD TERMINAL screen. TO
go from the TELEMETRY screen to the TERMINAL screen, use the "K" 
or "C<ENTER>" commands as shown below.  Use ESC to return to the 
TELEMETRY screen.

The KEYBOARD screen is either BLACK or BLUE depending on whether
the ground station TNC is "CONNECTED" or "UNCONNECTED".

WHile on the KEYBOARD screen, the ground station TNC can be in one
of two modes.  COMMAND mode and CONVERSE mode.  In COMMAND mode, 
there is a "cmd:" prompt which allows you to enter commands into the
local TNC.  This is a dangeous mode, and you should not type any
ocommands in this mode unless directed.  There are over 100 commmands
and just about any keystrokes can be wrongly interpreted as commands.

To go from COMMAND mode to CONVERSE mode, press the K key.
To go from CONVERSE mode to COMMAND mode, press ^C.

In CONVERSE MODE, anything you type will be transmitted over the
radio just as typed.  THe TNC can be in either  CONNECTED MODE or
UNCONNECTED MODE.  Usually when you are in command mode, you are 
unconnected until you logon to ANDE.  Then the screen will go blue 
and you will enter CONNECTED mode.  In CONNECTED MODE, your data
is point-to-point with ACKS line-by-line to assure devliery.  In
UNCONNECTED mode, your data is transmitted once in the blind in
broadcast mode to anyone listening.

INSTANTTRACK TRACKING PROGRAM:

If the MAP is not showing, QUIT back to the main menu.  If you go 
too far, re-execute ther program at the DOS prompt as "IT".  From
the main menu, select option 2, REAL-TIME-TRACK and select ANDE as
satellite number 17.  If you are already on the MAP, use the left
and right arrow keys to select ANDE number 17.

Hit W to see the time to the next pass.
Hit F to toggle on and off FAST or REAL-TIME mode
Hit SPACE to freeze time.


OPERATIONS;

Observe the AZ/EL to the satellite.  Point the Antenna to the correct
AZimuth.  When ANDE comes above the horizon, keep the antenna within
about 15 degrees of the satellite and begin hitting the "P" key on
the laptop about once a second while listening for any response from
ANDE.  You will be transmitting on radio memory channel 6 which TX's
on 144.47 and listens on 145.825.  Ping for up to 20 seconds until
you hear responses.  When you are hearing clean responses, then you
should be able to logon.

LOGON SIDE B:  Logon to side B with the "L B" command.  The radio will 
then automatically attempt 10 CONNECT attempts.  If a CONNECTION is
successful the spacecraft will send a 6 number challenge.  The laptop
will automatically calculate a matching password and send it.  If this
process is successful, then the screen will automatically shift to the
BLUE KEYBOARD screen with you  in CONVERSE mode ready to talk to the
satellite's command "prompt:".

THe only command for side B is "TE 1", then hit ENTER.  When you see
"TELEMETRY WAS 5" you were successful, so now disconnect by hitting
^C and then at your TNC "cmd:" prompt, enter "D" <ENTER> to disconnect.
YOu may hit D <ENTER> a second time to save time.

LOGON SIDE A:  Once side B is awake, usually side A also wakes up.
TUNE THE RADIO to memory channel 3 which is TX and RX on 145.825.

Hit ESC to be sure you are back on the TELEMETRY screen and hit "P"
key to PING side A.  When you hear responses, LOGON to side A with 
the "L A" command and as above, you should get to the BLUE screen
again.  As on side B, also enter "TE 1" and when it is successful,
disconnect as above with the ^C to "cmd:" and then enter the "D"
command twice.

HIT ESC TO GET BACK TO TELEMETRY SCREEN.

QUICKLY CHANGE THE RADIO BACK TO SIDE B (MEMORY 6) and now press the
"P" PING key to ping on side B for the remainder of the pass.  YOu 
should get into a rythm, so that you first hear a side A telemetry,
then a side B telemetry once every 10 seconds, and then hit the PING.

This will keep ANDE awake through the end of the pass.

After LOS and less than one minute of no activity, side B will go to
sleep and then side A will follow.  During this entire evolution, all
of the packets heard from ANDE will hopefully appear on ALOGGER.
