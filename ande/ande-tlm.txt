ANDE TELEMETRY                                          4 Sept 2003
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ANDE uses the same telemetry frame format as used by PCsat which
consists of a packet header, serial number counter and then five
channels of 8 bit decimal telemetry followed by 8 on/off status 
bits.  The 5 channel A/D converters are multiplexed to 4 banks
of five telemetry channels each for a total of 20 channels.

Routine telemetry is transmitted once a  minute whenever ANDE is 
over a ground station or users.  The  banks are switched every 45
seconds or so, so that in 4 minutes, we see all 4 banks.

The ANDE Telemetry Frame Format is the standard APRS format as 
shown below:

   ANDE>APRS,SGATE:T#nnn,CH1,CH2,CH3,CH4,CH5,xxxxxxxx
   
   Where: ANDE       - AX.25 callsign of ANDE
          APRS       - AX.25 generic TOCALL
          SGATE      - digipeater address for Internet Gateways
          T#nnn      - a 3 decimal digit serial number
          CH1 to CH5 - 5 telemety channels (3 digit decimal)
          xxxxxxxx   - an 8 byte (8 bit binary) number showing
                       the state of the output bits

The telemetry multiplexer can feed any of the four banks of
telemetry channels to the standard format as shown below:

FRAME 00:   CH1 - 8v Regulator Voltage
            CH2 - X arrays solar current 
            CH3 - Y arrays solar current
            CH4 - Z arrays Solar current
            CH5 - 5v Reference voltage

FRAME 01:   CH1 - Laser Battery voltage
            CH2 - Battery A1 current
            CH3 - Battery A2 current
            CH4 - Battery B1 current
            CH5 - Battery B2 current

FRAME 10:   CH1 - Temperature Battery A
            CH2 - Temperature Solar cell 1
            CH3 - Temperature Solar cell 2
            CH4 - Temperature Solar cell 3
            CH5 - Temperature Retro Reflector 1

FRAME 11:   CH1 - Temperature Battery B
            CH2 - Sleep Timer clock phase
            CH3 - LASER Temperature
            CH4 - Time-to-Go (how much of the 1 minute timer remains
            CH5 - Run-time-counter (25.5 hours max)

Since ANDE cold boots from sleep mode on each pass, the serial 
number will only show counts from the start of each pass and will
have no long term significance.  The Communications run-time 
counter is modulo 25.5 hours of ON time.  This should give an
expected end-around count is every 10 days or so of anticipated
operations.
