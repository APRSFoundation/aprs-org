ANDE COMM/LASER Functional Test Procedures:                22 July 2005
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This revision includes updates from 22 July pre-vib functional test and
is specific to testing the lasers with the COMM system using the box-
level test apparatus and test harness and connectors.  

EQUIPMENT: 
   ANDE Comm Test Set with cross connect cable assembly
   Bench Power supply for 14.4 volts at 1.2 amp
   Sensor Simulator Plug assembly
   GSE Laptop connected to test set
   GSE RF briefcase with laptop and transceiver.

SETUP PROCEDURE:
----------------

0) Boot both PC's, cancel any windows logon window.
1) Run USNA002.exe on PC's.  Use password "lmur" ENTER, hit ENTER.
2) Configure for ANDE with alt-S-USAGE-ANDE to see ANDE screen.
3) Plug the test set Power-A plug into left side connector on module
   COMM-01 and Power-B into the left side connector on COMM-02.
4) Plug the test set DB-9 Serial port into the GSE Laptop.
5) Plug TELM A & B test cables into right side connectors of COMM1 & 2
6) Set power supply to 14.4 volts, set current limit knobs to about 1.5
   amps (which is about the 12:00 oclock position)
7) Turn all switches on the Test Set to off (down).  
8) Plug the Red and  Black leads into the power supply.
9) Optional, on RF station, turn radio on and set to 145.825,(MR 0).
10) Turn on RF power meter to switch position factor "1".
11) Turn on small radio shack speaker volume control.
12) Connect RF wattmeter or dummy load to COMM-01 module RF connector.
13) Connect dummy load (2 attenuators) to RF connector on COMM-02.

LASER CONNECTION PROCEDURE:
---------------------------

THe side B TELM connector contains two pigtails, one for each laser
system.  The  ground wire is stripped gray.  The power lead is stripped
yellow.  On each laser system, connect the ground wire to the pin at 
the 4 o'clock position.  Connect the yellow wire to the pin at the 2 
o'clock position. 

Double check polarity and position.

SOFTWARE AND MODES BACKGROUND:  (Same as COMM test procedures)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Review the mode switching procedures from the COMM Test plan.  Here
is a summary:

SOFTWARE can be in two modes:  TELEMETRY screen and KEYBOARD screen.

  C C ENTER will transition from TELEMETRY to the KEYBOARD screen 
            *AND* will also send a ^C to place any TNC into cmd: mode.

  K         will transition from TELEMETRY to KEYBOARD screen directly
            without going to cmd: mode.  Any typing in this mode will
            pass transparently through the TNC and be transmitted.
            Hitting a ^C here can get you from converse to cmd: mode.
  ESC       ESC will transition from the KEYBOARD screen to TELEMETRY.

A TNC (terminal Node controller) can be in two modes, cmd: and CONVERSE.

  Use "K ENTER"   as a command to go from cmd: to CONVERSE.   
  Use ^C from CONVERSE mode to cmd:  mode.
  
You will frequently transition between all these modes.  So these detail
transition entries are not listed in each step in these procedures but
are assumed to be an operator skill.

DELAYS:  There are delays in the handshaking RF command modes becuase of 
the line-by-line protocol overhead.  Several seconds may be required.  
Further due to shared resources on the ANDE systems, there can be as 
much as a 10 second delay in response to some commands via the GSE port.

PREPARATION AND INITIAL POWER UP PROCEDURES:
--------------------------------------------

While watching the current load on the Power Supply perform these steps:

Turn on Battery 1 switch.             Verify =< 0.01 A on power supply.
Turn on Sep-Switch.                   Verify =< 0.01 Amp .
Turn on the RX-A wake switch.         Verify about 0.07 Amp or less
Wait 15 secs.              Verify 1st Bulletin current >= 0.50 Amps
Turn on Battery 3 switch (B1).
Turn on the Receiver B switch.        Verify .12 Amps
If all OK to this point, it is safe to proceed with the test.

PANIC-SHUT-DOWN procedures:  Simply unplug red lead from Power Supply.


LASER TEST PROCEDURES:
----------------------

Flip all battery switches, and the SEP switch up.  This will be the 
post-separation deployed configuration.

For this LASER test configuration, all telemetry and comnmanding will
be done from side B.  Set the RX-A wake switch off and RX-B switch on.

Flip the PC switch to B side (up) and hit the ESC key to assure you 
are in the telemetry screen.  Then hit C C ENTER to cmd: mode.
Send these commands: TE 1, MXM ON and MON ON each followed by ENTER.
If successful (no EH?'s after 10 seconds) hit ESC back to telemetry.
After 40 seconds you should see side B on the RF systems screen:

              A      B                  A1     A2     B1     B2
   VOLTS    13.5   13.3    Currents A:  35     38     30     30  mA
   X-SOL     .01    .01    Currents B:  35     38     30     30  mA
   Y-SOL     .01    .01    Volts:       .2 V  
   Z-SOL     .01    .01    Use counter:       _____   
   5-volts   5.02          Temperatures:  all ambient

The B side telemetry is of interest.  The A side may or may not show
depending on its wakefullness.

WARNING:  Laser ON times should not exceed 5 minutes without at least
a five minute cool down period.  This limitation is in the COMM power
system, not the laser system.

To control the LASERS, first select the B2 battery system:

Send CTR ON     Notice that CTR ON turns on both A and B together.
                The only verificatin will be after 40 seconds of
                telemetry, you will see the available laser voltage
                in the upper right area of the telemetry screen
                under the B2 column in the VOLTS row.

Send LEDS ON    This activates the lasers.  There is a 5+ second 
                delay before they begin firing.

Send LEDS OFF   You may send L ON or L OFF as needed to test the
                lasers.  Maximum ON dutycycling should not exceed 5m.

END TEST:  On GSE Labtop, hit ESC and then send these commands:
   C C ENTER   To get to ANDE side B cmd: prompt.
   LEDS OFF    To turn off LASER POWER
   CTR OFF     To turn off battery selections.

SHUT DOWN PROCEDURES:
---------------------
- Turn off all test set switches starting right to left.  
- Unplug red wire from power supply, turn Power supply off.
- Turn off the small battery powered Speaker box
- Turn the RF wattmeter switch to OFF.
- Exit USNA002.EXE with the FILE-QUIT-YES command.
- Disconnect connections if needed.
