ANDE & RAFT respond,  FCAL heard.                2200z, 21 Dec, 2006
--------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              WB4APR

To date, we had RAFT with telemetry, but refusing to respond to
logons, and ANDE stuck in the can.  FCAL was floating away with one 
packet heard....

During the 2200z pass over the Naval Academy, we decided to 
concentrate on ANDE.  This involves sending 16 seconds of 1 second 
packets to try to wake it up.  TO my surprise, RAFT relayed the 
packet (it shouldn't have). 

!T 22:02:00 !W3ADO-15>APRS,RAFT*,qAO,W3ADO:Ping...# 118 

SO we scrambled to find our checkout plans from yesterday and
logged onto RAFT and enabled the voice experiment.  It spoke!

Then, apparently with all the noise on the channel, we also woke up 
ANDE and got one telemetry packet from it.  Decoded, ANDE MAA
reports:

!T 22:02:55
!ANDE-1>BEACON,qAO,W3ADO:T#003,041,135,137,148,146,10101110,000

1) It had been awake for 3 minutes
2) The +X, +Y, +Z and RETRO were at 25, 26, 28 and 29 deg C
3) The B side battery temp was off-scale low 

But we have seen this anomolous side B temperature before during
testing and are not concerned since the temperature up there seems 
to be a nice balmy day in space.  And we get correct side B temps 
from the Side B system. (Have not yet tried side B).

RAFT telemetry counter is about to roll over, having completed
965 minutes of continuous operation since achieving power positive 
status.  It will roll over to 000 in 25 minutes.

!T 22:02:35 !RAFT>BEACON,SGATE,qAO,W3ADO:T#962,087,102,037,064,087,00000000,412
!T 22:03:37 !RAFT>BEACON,SGATE,qAO,W3ADO:T#963,089,083,050,019,087,00000000,520
!T 22:04:37 !RAFT>BEACON,SGATE,qAO,W3ADO:T#964,086,094,037,057,089,00000000,999
!T 22:05:36 !RAFT>BEACON,SGATE,qAO,W3ADO:T#965,087,084,058,023,093,00000000,999

The end values of 412, 520, and 999 are SEU counts from a wash
of RAM in RAFT.  This was a just-for-grins piece of code that we
do not necessarily believe.  We often saw 999's on the ground
too.  So we will watch this as well.

We have spent no time with the complexities of NMARS since all 4
satellites are in view at the same time.  NMARS can wait until
they separate enough so we can concentrate on one at a time.

We are checking on why RAFT responded to a PING.  We had made a
last minute flight rom change on NMARS so that it would respond
to a PING from boot up, but maybe this change also got into the
RAFT ROM as well.  Of course turning that feature on was one of
our first steps, so it is good that it was on anyway.
