ANDE COMM Card Test Procedure:                       Rev1   14 May 2004
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure uses the ANDE COMM Test Set to functional test all
aspects of the Comm Module.

EQUIPMENT: 
   ANDE Comm Test Set and cable assembly
   Bench Power supply for 14.6 volts at 1.2 amp
   Sensor Simulator Plug
   Laptop running USNA-gnd.EXE

SETUP PROCEDURE:

1) Run USNA-gnd.ex.  Enter password "lmur", hit ENTER.
2) Configure for ANDE with alt-S-USAGE-ANDE to see ANDE screen.
3) Plug ANDE COMM Test Set into Interface Module and the
   DB-9 Serial port into Laptop.   
4) Plug Sensor Simulator into Interface Module
5) Set power supply to 14.6 volts, current limit initially
   set to 100 mA.  Turn all switches on the Test Set to
   off (down).  Plug the Red and Black leads into the power
   supply.

TEST PROCEDURES:

Turn on Battery 1 switch.      Verify < 1mA and top alt-pwr LED lights
Turn on Sep-Switch.            Verify less than 0.01 Amp 
Turn on the Receiver Switch.   Verify about 0.07 Amp or less
Turn on the Current Limit Override switch to prepare for XMIT.
Wait 15 seconds.   Verify first Bulletin packet, and > 0.50 Amps
On Keyboard, execute these commands:
   C       to get the software to Communicate with the TNC 
   ^C      to get to command mode (cmd: prompt (after some delay))
   MXM ON  to enable monitoring of ANDE's own packets
   TE 1    to set telemetry to every 10 seconds.
   ESC key to get back to telemetry monitoring screen
After 40 seconds, verify all telemetry fields are updated (except Sol):
 
              A     B                      A       B
   VOLTS    14.4  13.7          Currents:  52 mA   58 mA
   X-SOL     .25   .23          Volts:    2.1 V   1.9 V
   Y-SOL     .25   .23
   Z-SOL     .23   .23
   5-volts   5.0   5.0          Temperatures:  all ambient

Jumper 51 Ohm resistor on Sensor Simulator with 14.6 volts momentarily.
Verify Solar Cell currents about 0.25 volts.  You may also see
sensor simulator temperatures rise.

Flip Battery 2 switch up.      Verify Lower Power LED ON.
     Verify telemetry shows split of power between bat 1 & 2, mostly on 1.

Flip Battery 1 switch down.    Verify all current shifts to Bat 2.

Send LEDS ON.     Verify nothing happens

Send CTRL A ON.   Verify LASER Test LED comes on. current ^ 600 mA

Flip Battery 1&3 switchs on and then Battery 2 switch off.  
     Verify laser LED off showing that only battery 2 powers laser.

Send CTRL A OFF then CTRL B ON.  Verify laser LED comes ON

Flip Battery 4 switch on and then battery 3 switch off.
     Verify laser LED off showing that only battery 3 powers laser.

Send CTRL A ON.   Verify laser LED comes ON.

Send LEDS OFF.    Verify laser LED goes off.

After  1 min 45 seconds verify receipt of second Bulletin
After  4 min 15 seconds verify receipt of third Bulletin
After 10 min 30 seconds verify receipt of fourth Bulletin

Send LEDS ON.  Verify laser LED comes ON.
Flip RCVR Switch off.  Verify laser LED OFF and power drops below 0.01
immediately or within 45 seconds.

Verify RX wakes up for 2 seconds every 16 or 57 secs (A or B).

Wait till RX lamp lights and send an RF packet from the Handi-Talkie.
     Verify system stays awake for 45 seconds or so.  And then goes off.

Turn Power supply off.
Exit USNA-gnd.EXE with the FILE-QUIT-YES command.
Disconnect connections as needed.
