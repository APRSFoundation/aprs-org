These notes summarize concerns as they arrise and as they are resolved
to document the design issues and history.

RTS Serial PORT Blockage:   RTS is used as a telemetry driver, this blocks 
RXD data for half the time.  This is of no concern during flight because 
nothing is connected to the serial port.  HOWEVER, the SPEECH module is 
thus connected and will have speech delayed by as much as the telemetry 
cycle period.

LATCHING RELAYS:  The side B RELAY drivers are available for latching
relays if needed.  This can give us some memory of two selected commands:

	LOW RATE SIDE B:  One idea is to let a relay be designated as a 
      HIGH/LOW rate sleep timer selector.  Everytime the LAZERS are 
      commanded, a pulse would latch the relay to the LOW rate position 
	for side B, keeping it very dormant.  If side A dies, then B could
	be logged onto eventually and commanded to CLEAR this relay.  Thus,
	B would enter high rate for the remainder of the mission.
