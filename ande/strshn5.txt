This Naval Academy command and control system for ANDE has 
been flight proven on PCsat and will provide the following 
capabilities on orbit with the minimum power requirements suitable 
for this mission:

1) Routine telemetry every 1 minute when in view of command station
2) Telemetry of 5 analog parameters (0-5 volts)
3) Three on/off command channels and bidirectional RS-232 channel
4) AX.25 1200 baud compatibilitiy with all existing packet systems 
   and the worldwide internet linked APRS gnd stations on 145.825.
5) PCsat style communications worldwide at low duty cycle
6) Reception by student stations with only a whip antenna.
6) Average power requirement of only 0.2W

The average power requirement of 0.2 watt for a mission life of one
year can easily be met with either of the following two power 
systems:

  * Ten 1.5" square solar panels equally distributed on the sphere
  * OR, the equivalent of 120 Alkaline D Cells.

The extremely low power budget is met with the following operations
plan which does not sacrifice any significant operational functions
of the PCsat type mission but achieves a 20 to one power savings.

1) Except for a microwatt timer, all electronics are off
2) Once every 20 seconds for 2 secs, the TNC and receiver are powered up.
3) If no one connects to the TNC, then it powers back off.
4) If someone connects, the CONNECTED state holds the system ON.
5) While SYSOP is connected, TNC and RX are on, the system is fully
   usable like PCsat.  It will send once a minute telemetry, it
   will respond to the 3 ON/OFF BIT commands, and it is optionally
   available to users to use as a packet relay.

POWER BUDGET:

To determine the power budget, the Satellite is assumed to be in view
of each command station on 4 passes a day.  There are about 6 full
time commmand station areas, East USA, West USA, East Europe, West
Europe, east Australia and Japan.  The satellite may be used in other
locations, but the duty cycle will be insignificant to these six.

Each such pass is assumed to last 10 minutes.  Thus the total access
times average to about 120 minutes a day for an 8% dutycycle.  All the
rest of the time, the TNC/Receiver are only waking up for 2 seconds
out of every 20 for another 8% duty cycle.  The transmitter is assumed
to transmit 10 Telemetry packets, 10 overhead packets, and 10 user
packets per pass for a total of 30 in 10 minutes for a 5% duty cycle
per pass.

  Receiver  - 30ma @ 9 volts @ 16%       = .06 W
  TNC       - 15ma @ 9 volts @ 16%       = .03 W
  XMTR      - 900ma @ 9 volts @ 5% of 8% = .05 W
  Total AVERAGE Power                    = .14 W

This power can be met with the equivalent of 120 Alkaline D Cells
(120* 16 AHrs * 1.5 volts)/(365*24) = .2 W for one year or 10 evenly
spaced solar panels of 0.2 W each.  An illumination factor of
1.8 is assumed which accounts for the cosine-theta illumination of
multiple panels and a 200% charge factor is assumed to make up for
the 70% charge efficiency and 45% maximum eclipse.

This 0.2 W solar panel requirement can be met with about 1.5 square 
inch of silicon.  To maximize active surface material, only 4 PV cells 
per panel are used to give a self regulating charge to a single 1.2 
volt NICAD cell.  Each of the 5 NiCd cells is connected to two solar 
panels on opposide sides of the spacecraft to guarantee sun. 

Some of this data is obsolete and needs to be revised...
