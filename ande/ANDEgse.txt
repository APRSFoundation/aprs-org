ANDE Ground Service Equipment and Integration Tests            31 Oct 02
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following details the Ground Support Equipment for ANDE from the
perspective of the Communications Payload:

GSE TEST SET:

    RF Tests:
       Wattmeter          - 5 Watt slug
       Signal Generator   - 145.8 MHz
       Data Transceiver   - 0.1Watt  Kenwood TH-D7A
       Modem              - Kantronics KPC-3+

    Communications Tests:
       Laptop             - Windows 98 or earlier.  All sofware will fit
                            on a single 1.44 Floppy disk
       Serial cable       - Connects Laptop to GSE port on ANDE
       Break-out-Box      - For voltage tests
       Digital Multimeter - For voltage tests and continuity tests

    General support:
       ANDE GSE Power Supply - 1 amp at 10-15 volts
       Tool box
       Carrying case   

GSE Tests Prior to hemisphere mating:

    COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM:

       Final tweak of TX/RX frequencies to within 100 Hz of spec
             Decision is OK if within 1 KHz
       Final veriication of RX sensitivity (Tune to spec)
             Decision is OK if within 3 dB of spec
       Final verification of TX power out. (Tune for peak)
             Decision is OK if within 2 dB of spec
       Final verification of TNC operation.
             TNC must be fully operational and pass all tests
             Final ROM checksum will be recorded

    POWER SYSTEM:
       
       On each battery pack, verify all 14 strings for voltage
          Replace if any strings per pack show OPEN fuses
       On each string verify a 100 mA 1 second Load test
          Replace if any string is more than 20% not normal
       Verify continuity and function of SEP switches with test magnet
          Replace if any contacts fail open or closed.

GSE TESTS AFTER MATING:  (conducted via GSE port)

    COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM:

       Confirm operation of TNC's A and B
          Replace if inoperative
       Confirm operation of TX/RX's A and B
          Replace if inoperative
       Hang ANDE in RF range (or clear of all conductors) and do final
          transmitter load match tuning via access hole

    BATTERY SYSTEM:

       Voltage checks on all four battery test points.
          Replace if any packs have no output (bad fuses)
       Perform 700 mA 1 sec load test on each battery tray
          Replace if +/- 20% abnormal

    SEPARATION SWITCHES

       Verify continuity and function of SEP switches.
          Replace if any contacts are failed open or closed.
