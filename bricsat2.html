 <B>BRICSAT2 (USNAP1)</B> was launched as a sister cubesat with PSAT2 on 25 June 2019 and awoke on about 25 July with good downlinks 
on VHF.  It is another one of many APRS Networked Amateur Satellites but has a thruster experiment to see if it can maneuver
to better separate from PSAT2 to provide better dual coverage for users.  Its APRS callsign is USNAP1.  
The downlinks from all APRS satellites
is found on the <A HREF="sats.html"><B>aprs.org/sats.html</B></A> page.

<B>The unique features of BRICSAT2 </B> are the APRS transponder and its electric Ion proplusion thruster experiment 
which are modularized into
standard Cubesat bus modules and integrated into a 1.5U cubesat.  It was deployed together with the sister 1.5U PSAT2.

<B>OVERVIEW:</B> . USNAP1 is a communications and electric micro-propulsion project of some students at the 
Naval Academy launched on the STP-2 SpaceX mission which should have a life span of several years.  

<P>
<B>USNAP1 </B>
continues the <A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCsat</B></A>(2001) and <A HREF="psat.html"><B>PSAT</B></A>(2015) missions noted above containing
an APRS packet radio communications transponder for relaying remote users, telemetry, 
sensor and ham radio experimental data 
from remote users and amateur radio environmental experiments or other data sources to all users 
 via the global network
of internet linked volunteer ground stations.  The APRS transponder also includes  
telemetry, and some command and control for the user modes.  
<P>

<IMG SRC="bricsat/bricsat-2-stack.png" align=right>

<B>Operations under ITU Rules:</B> USNAP1 operates under the ITU rules of the Amateur Satellite Service.  
See how USNAP1 design and operation fit entirely within the ITU International Amateur Radio 
<A HREF="PSAT2/PSAT2-BRICSAT2-ITU-rules.txt"><B> RULES</B></A>.  The FCC does not issue
licesnses for Amateur Radio Spacecraft but accepts the control operators filing his Advance Notice or API
for documenting the operation.
<A HREF="PSAT2/FCC%20Public%20Notice-clarified-a.doc">(see public notice)</A> Amateur sateliltes are operated under the
license of the individual amateur radio operator who is responsable to assure
that both the design and operation are within the rules of the ITU as interpreted by the IARU.

<B>Packet Downlink</B> . . 145.825 1200 baud APRS (shared with ISS, PCSAT, PSAT2, AISAT, UO11 and others!)
<BR><B>Packet Uplink</B> . . . . .145.825 MHz same as other satellites
<BR><B>Telemetry link </B> . . . . 437.605 MHz for 9600 baud telemetry (callsign USNA14)


<P>
<B>USNAP1</B> is another APRS satellite that can digipeat user packets just like the original 
<A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCSAT</B></A> (NO44)
and the packet system on the ISS.</B>  USNAP1 also supports the same digipeating alias of ARISS 
and APRSAT so that users do not have to change any parameters when using any of these three APRS transponders.  

<P>

<B>APRS Digipeater:</B> When the DIGI is on, the satellite's call is USNAP1 and the TOCALL is APDIGI.  
When it is off, the callsign is USNAP1-1 and the tocall is APOFF.  
The ALIASes are the usual, ARISS, APRSAT. 
<P>

<B>LIVE Telemetry Downlink:</B> Like other APRS satellites, the telemetry will also be captured on Steve Dimse's, K4HG original
FINDU.COM links that we have now consolidated all APRS satelites onto the single page 
<A HREF="sats.html"><B>aprs.org/sats.html</B></A>. 

Amateur APRS packet relay is the primary mission once the spacecraft passes its on-orbit checkout and propulsion
experiments are no longer taking all available power.

<B>OVERVIEW:</B> . USNAP1 is a project of some students at the Naval Academy 
working with students at GW university to integrate propulsion into our communications cubesat 
satellite designs following on to several previous student project satellites
which contain an APRS packet radio communications transponder for relaying remote telemetry, 
sensor and user data 
from remote users and amateur radio environmental experiments or other data sources back to 
Amateur Radio experimenters via a global network
of internet linked volunteer ground stations.  The data transponder also includes all 
telemetry, command and control for a complete cubesat. 
<P>

<P>

<B>Operations in the Amateur Satellite Service:</B>
The APRS transponder on USNAP1 is operated in the Amateur Satellite Service to encourage 
amateur radio students, educators and experimenters 
around the world to contribute additional satellities to this constellation on 145.825 MHz or
to build interesting self motivated remote sensors suitable for the uplink channel.
 See our
<A HREF="buoy.html"><B>ocean or bay oceanographic data buoys</B></A> for examples.
  
This kind of Amateur Radio experimentation fits well in the ITU rules
<A HREF="bricsat/PSAT2-BRICSAT2-ITU-rules.txt"><B>(see BRICSAT2 justification)</B></A> 
for operating in this service
and well serve amateur radio's educational and outreach goals for student projects encouraging young people to
be interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.

<P>


<B>APRS Packet Transponder:</B> The COMMS card and APRS packet transponder (at right)
is an AX.25 Packet Radio TNC similar to what is flying on 
<A HREF="pcsat.html"><B>PCsat</B></A> and the
<A HREF="http://www.aprs.org/ariss.net"><B>ISS</B></A>.  This card evolved from the 
<A HREF="http://byonics.com/mtt4b"><B> BYONICS.COM model MTT4B</B></A>
 and modified to fit a standard Cubesat format.
This ongoing APRS mission in space on the original PCsat 
is now over 18 years old and pioneered
this very popular operating mode via the ISS since 2006.  Both of these 
missions deliver packets to users worldwide via the global network of
volunteer ground stations feeding the two downlink capture pages:
<A HREF="http://pcsat.findu.com"><B>psat.findu.com</B></A> and
<A HREF="http://ariss.net"><B>ariss.net</B></A>.  These pages display live maps such as the one
above, of the most
recent user position data and capture all message traffic between users. 
See the <A HREF="psat/APRS%20Link%20Budgets%20for%20Psat-a.doc"><B>APRS link budgets</B></A>. 


<P>

<B>Attitude Control:</B> The primary attitude control for USNAP1 is the electric Propulsion thrusters 
built in colaboration with students at the George Washington University.  
These offset thrusters can both change the attitude of USNAP1 but also do some orbit maneuvering 
to better distribute the 145.825 MHz channel access amongh the various APRS sateliltes.
<P>


<B>Global Experimental Data Channel:</B>  USNAP1 supports the space segment of this
global amateur radio APRS packet initiative to encourage both new satellite construction in support of this experimental
data channel and lower cost amateur radio buoy and sensor experimentation at other schools as shown below.  
We hope to continue an ongoing full time presence in
space to continue this support of the 145.825 data uplink channel for future experiments.  
To this end we hope other schools to either build additional 145.825 MHz relay satellites 
and/or to build experimental sensors.  We have evolved the PSAT, PSAT2, USNAP1 cubesat design
into a low cost wasy of building innexpensive amateur 1U cubesats we call PSAT1U as shwon below and on the
<A HREF="psat1u.html"><B>PSAT1U web page</B></A>.

<IMG SRC="PSAT1U/PSAT1U-boards-PR-shot-65xx.jpg">
<P>
<A HREF="psat1u.html"><B>PSAT1U Development Projects:</B></A> The APRS Comms mission on all our amateur sateliltes has now evolved into
a common baseline for easily building innexpensive cubesats as shown above.  Not only can they fly in space if
lucky enough to find a launch, our students also build them forin-lab hands-on development testing.  With
torque coils embedded into the solar panels, they can be suspended on a string in the lab and demonstrate sun pointing
and Bdot and other ADCS modes.
