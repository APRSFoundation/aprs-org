PREEMPTIVE DIGIPEATING                                 4 Dec 2012
-----------------------------------------------------------------

PREMPTIVE DIGIPEATING DEFINITION (rev b):  When ON, the digi will 
begin searching at the first unused digipeater field and then to 
the end for a match to any of its potential matching aliases 
(MYCALL, MYALIAS, UIDIGI).  If a match, it will mark that and all 
prior fields as HAS-BEEN-USED, it will REPLACE its ALIAS with its 
MYCALL and will digipeat it once.  All remaining fields are still 
active.

GENERIC XXXXn-N DIGIPEATING should not do preemptive digipeating.

INDICATORS:  When the packet is preemptively digipeated, all
the digifields prior to the preempted field can either be 
DROPPED, or MARKED.  

DROPPED:  If dropped, then the preempted ALIAS becomes
the first digipeater field, it is replaced with the MYCALL of the 
digipeater, the has-been-digipeated-bit is set, and the remaining
path remains intact. All prior path data is lost.  

MARKED:   If MARKED is SET, then the full path prior to the 
preempted alias is retained but the LSB of the two RR bits is set 
to 1 and the has-been-digipeated-bit is also set for all unused 
digi fields prior to and including the preempted ALIAS.  As 
before, the ALIAS is replaced with MYCALL indicating the field 
was prempted.

In the GATEWAY scenario, one would probably use the DROP setting.  
In the normal network scenario, then the MARK setting might be 
the best setting.

PRIORITY BIT:  Now why not use the other RR bit in the SSID field 
for a PRIORITY bit.  The existing default value of the RR bit is 1 
and will indicate a PRIORITY  packet but if "0", then this packet 
is of less priority and can be dropped in future networks that 
recognize it..

RR-BITS: See definition of these bits, see figure 2.2.13.1.1 in:
http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html

So the PREMPT TNC command now has 3 settings:  OFF, DROP, MARK to 
indicate how to indicate the action.

PACKETS TO HOME SCENARIO:  In this scenario your goal is to get 
your packets targeted to a particular digi or area.  The path 
WIDE2-2,HOMEX With the HOMEX digipeater recognizing pre-emptive 
digipeating would make sure that all your packets got to HOMEX 
in from 1 to 3 hops.  To get them say 4 hops from City A to City B
 without flooding everywhere, the path WIDE1-1,CITYA,WIDE2-1,CITYB 
would get to CITYB no matter where you are in A or B or inbetween, 
but not involve ANY OTHER DIGI's than the shortest path between 
them.  ETC...

Or CITYD,CITYC,CITYB,CITYA would let you go on a trip to CItyD, 
but your packets would get back home to A no matter where you were 
inbetween.  When close, then they would only go 1 hop.  Or if you 
wanted those at CityD to anticipate your arrival, you might use 
the path CITYA,CITYB,CITYC,CITYD and then your packets would all 
preceed you to CITYD until you got there, but with fewer and fewer 
hops as you got close.

GATEWAY SCENARIO:  IN this scenario there is a special event on 
FREQB with lots of FREQB digis that desires to get at least one 
(and only 1) copy of each packet into the 144.39 system via a 
cross-channel gateway with the callsign GATE.  The path of 
FREQB7-7,GATE,WIDE2-1 would make sure that a packet got everywhere 
in the special event network but only one copy always gets through 
the gateway at least one hop into the APRS network.  (such as the 
linear appalachan trail event or an underground multihop cave 
event...

NO PREMPTIVE DIGIPEATING ON UIFLOOD and UITRACE.  The reason is, 
that it would preclude any use of any kind of WIDEn-N AFTER going 
through a gate, and that is one of the main reasons for doing it.

Remember, these 4 hop Premptive SPECIFIC paths are MUCH less load 
on the network than a WIDE4-4 which can potentially cause 34 DUPES, 
compared to only a maximum of 4 hops with the explicit preemptive 
hop approach.

Have I missed anything?
