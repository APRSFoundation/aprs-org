BAR-CODE Formats for APRS                                  26 Feb 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the beginning of some thoughts on Bar-Code formats for APRS
that started on the APRSSIG today.  We may as well consider this for
APRS 1.2 addendum.

From the SIG:

I think a BarCode Application is ideal for APRS.

I hope we can integrate the Barcodes into APRS in a seamless way
so that they can be tabulated even on existing machines.  Here
are some options:

>STATUS Packet...   
:BLN1SCAN :A bulletin to all
:DATABASEx:A message to "databaseX callsign"
=POSIT/position comment text

MESSAGE FORMAT:  A message to a specific applications callsign
would be great for generic applications.  The message contains
the barcode.  Using the message format assures the data will be 
captured by all APRS clients and can be captured in FINDU etc.

BARCODE POSIT FORMAT:  The BAR CODE POSIT format is good for an 
application where the barcode itself contains the posit data.
An example might be the barcode wand is moving through a building 
or something (or a cave) and whenever they see a barcode on the 
wall, they scan it and their wand sends the LAT/LONG position 
encoded on the barcode AND any other data that is on the bar code.

WAND POSIT FORMAT:  Similar to the above, but in this mode the
packet contains the GPS position of the barcode scanner when it
scans a barcode and the barcode data is included in the position
report comment field.

Does anyone see any other applications that cannot be fit into 
either of these formats?
