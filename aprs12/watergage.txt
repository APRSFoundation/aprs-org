WATER GAUGES in APRS                                      29 June 06
--------------------------------------------------------------------

24 March 2011 UPDATE!!!!

As of March 24 2011, the standard format used by hundreds of
these sensors on FIRENET appears to be:

;09428508 *061713z3401.40N/11424.75Ww3.57gh/82cfs

Which is a standard OBJECT report with the text "3.57gh/82cfs".  This
means water gage number 09428508 with a reading of 3.57 GageHeight and
82 cubic feet per second.

Most of the details from this page have been folded into a 
generalized APRS1.2 addendum on all new additions to the WEATHER 
formats in APRS.

WATER GAUGE INFO:

In June 06, water level gage information was added to APRS.  There are 
two symbols, one for H2O "/w" and the other for FLOOD "\w".  The 
device can choose to send either of these symbols depending on its 
own threshold for "flooding".  Or instead, if additional weather data 
is avaiable it can simply add the water level information in the Fxxxx
format to a weather report.  As of March 24 2011, we have seen no 
gages use the weather format and all appear to be using the standard 
format used by hundreds of these sensors appears to be:

;09428508 *061713z3401.40N/11424.75Ww3.57gh/82cfs

Which is a standard OBJECT report with the text "3.57gh/82cfs".  This
means water gage number 09428508 with a reading of 3.57 GageHeight and
82 cubic feet per second.

In 2006 we also defined a water gage/flooding format for inclusion in
weather data.  In that case, the height above or below flood or tide 
level in inches was to be included in the position text (or weather
data string) as Fxxxx and that string is chosen to be compatible with
the standard APRS weather reporting parameters.  In addition, a voltage 
field Vvvv was also added. Thus, the usual APRS complete weather report 
string similar to:

  DIR/SPD/Gggg/Tttt/Rrrr/Pppp etc

is extended by adding these additional parameters for 

Fxxxx  water level above or below flood stage or mean tide in tenths
       of a foot.  Values can range between +999 and -999 in tenths 
       meaning -99.9 to +99.9 feet.  Meters are not used for the on
       air format because it gives too little or too much resolution
       to fit in the fixed length 4 bytes that are required.

Vxxx   battery volts in tenths   128 would mean 12.8 volts

Zxx    Device type

These fields can be added to a WX station report where the WX symbol 
would continue to be used, or to heighligh that the weather station
has a water gage, it can use the weather station overlay character of
"F".  The standard WX report allows for any field to be indicated as 
not available either by omission or by replacing the value with "...".
Since the wind direction and speed and temperature are required fields,
this means the minimum weather report with flood info is
   
WX symbol -plus-   .../...t...VxxxFxxxx

Notice that if water data is added to a WX report, then only Fxxxx
and optional Vxxx are added to the WX report.  

Examples are:

Weather reports:
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW_ddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/Fxxxx...
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW_ddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/Fxxxx/Vvvv...
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW_ddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/Rrrr/PppppFxxxx...

Water Gage reports:
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWwFxxxx/ZFA
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWwFxxxxVvvv/ZFA
 DDMM.hhN\DDDMM.hhWwFxxxxVvvv/ZFA
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWwddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/Fxxxx/ZFA
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWwddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/FxxxxVvvv/ZFA
 DDMM.hhN\DDDMM.hhWwddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/FxxxxVvvv/ZFA

Notice that two of these indicate the FLOOD symbol (\).

Also notice that existing software needs to now consider parsing
the appearance of any WATER or FLOOD symbols to see if they also
include Weather.  Also, everyone's weather parser needs to look
at the WX fields for the optional additional Fxxxx or Vvvv fields.
