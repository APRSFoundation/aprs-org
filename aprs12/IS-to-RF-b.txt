IS-to-RF Selective Local Gating - A Proposal   (rev b)          28 Dec 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the best I can come up with for how local IGates can opt-in to 
allow *local* APRS-IS mobile applicatitons to also be seen locally on RF. 
I am not saying we agree to implement this.  I'm just making sure we are 
all looking at the same concept and debating only its merits, and not all 
the possible other bugaboos...

Rev A was abandoned, since somewhere along the line, the APRS-IS narrowed 
the original 1997 APRS-IS design which allowed TCPIP* to be in any of the
digi fields in an APRS-IS packet, and not just the first and only.  This
blocks any use of the APRS-IS path as an indicator for future applications.

So here is the best we can do...

NAME:  For identification, lets call this function RGATING.

PURPOSE:  To give RGate operators a local tool to allow local selective 
IS-to-RF gating for local mobile IS applications while giving him the 
means to control it based on his local environment (his IGate coverage 
range and channel loading).

SPEC:  The goal is to work this problem from both ends.  The Originating
clients are required operate within the same rate guidelines as any other
APRS station.  This gives the local RGATE operators greater flexibility 
in controling the local RF load.

IS CLIENT REQUIREMENTS:  Authors of mobile phone or other IS applications 
that inject such position packets are required to 

1) only use the APRS-IS path similar to this:

WB4APR-IS>APVVVV,TCPIP*:packet_data_goes_here...

2) Packets originated for RGATEing should conform to standard APRS 
packet rates.  Every 30 Minutes for benign fixed stations, every 10 minutes 
for operator-present stations, and a maximum for mobiles of 1 per minute.

3) All such packets must use the APRS decaying algorithm.  Meaning, if the 
position or data is unchanged from the last, then the period to the next 
packet is doubled down to the final rate of one per 30 minutes (same as 
all other APRS packets).

4) All such stations with any other VHF, UHF or HF radio should include
their operating frequency in the FFF.FFFMHz format.  See:

http://aprs.org/localinfo.html

RGATING REQUIREMENTS:  The RGATE sysop can choose among a variety 
of settings:

RGATE0 RANGE - the direct heard-range of the RGATE
RGATE1 RANGE - the 1 hop heard-range of the RGATE and digis
RGATE2 RANGE - the 2 hop heard-range of the RGATE and 2 tiers of digis
 
DIRECT RATE - sets the max allowed rate for RF DIRECT packets
ONEHOP RATE - sets the max allowed rate for 1 hop RF packets
TWOHOP RATE - sets the max allowed rate for 2 hop RF packets

RGATE0 LIMIT - the total number of such packets allowed per minute
RGATE1 LIMIT - the total number of such packets allowed per minute
RGATE2 LIMIT - the total number of such packets allowed per minute

NOFREQ-NOGATE - if on, will not igate any mobile without a contact freq

For example, a typical home IGate that (ideally) only uses a 1 hop RF path 
via the nearest local digipeaters might set his RGATE1 RANGE to only include 
the reliable coverage area of his local digis and then set ONEHOP RATE 4
The result would be only one packet from any IS-mobile once every 4 minutes.
Or he could set ONEHOP RATE = 2 and then have these mobiles appear once 
every 2 minutes.  ETC.

He sets the RGATEx LIMITS as a failsafe load limiting mechanism.  There 
is also a BLOCK list where any abusers callsigns can be blocked if they try 
to induce spam.

The NOFREQ-NOGATE option allows the local RGATE to ignore mobile IS apps
that have no means for participating in the local ham radio RF anyway.
I'm not interested in seeing IS clutter on the local RF, if he displays no 
interest in taking part in local Ham radio contacts.

Something like that.
