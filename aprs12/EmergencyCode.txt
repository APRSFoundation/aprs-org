EMERGENCY CODES for APRS                                      13 Feb 07
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Mic-E format used by many devices including the Kenwood TH-D7 and
TM-D700 radios have the provision for sending 3 status bits with these
meanings in each position report:

 EMERGENCY
 PRIORITY
 SPECIAL
 COMMITTED
 RETURNING
 INSERVICE
 ENROUTE
 OFF-DUTY

In the original APRS, these bits were to trigger these on-receipt-
responses:

 SPECIAL  - would CENTER the map on the symbol
 PRIORITY - would CENTER and ZOOM to 8 mile local range scale
 EMERGENCY- CENTER and ZOOM and ALARM beeps until cleared by operator.

And also the color attribute for the SYMBOL for these stations would
be shown in these colors:

 SPECIAL  - Yellow
 PRIORITY - Orange
 EMERGENCY- Red

There has long been a proposal that other software should be able to
send these same status bits.  But, since the bits are specially
encoded inside the unique Mic-E format, they are not available to 
other applications that do not use the Mic-E format.

Hence, it has been proposed that the following special strings can
be interpreted like the original Mic-E bits.  They are bracketed
by exclamation points (!) to set them out from normal text and the
are expected to be the first bytes of the free-field comment field
of any station.   The first bytes of the comment field of any
POSITION packet or OBJECT packet are located in the same place and
if PHG data is in the same packet, then these special designators
follow the PHG data.

 !TESTALARM!
 !EMERGENCY!
 !PRIORITY!
 !SPECIAL!
 !COMMITTED!
 !RETURNING!
 !INSERVICE!
 !ENROUTE!
 !OFF-DUTY!

Notice that an additional !TESTALARM! function has been added
that is supposed to trigger the same circuits and algorithms on
receipt as a real !EMERGENCY! field, except that it is CLEARLY
supposed to convey it is a TEST.

An Additional Proposal (has already been implemented in APRS+SA and
XASTIR), is the recognition of these additional CENTER and ZOOM 
triggers (but without the surrounding "!" bytes:

 !ALARM!
 !ALERT!
 !WARNING!
 !WXALARM!
 !EM!

And I would suggest that we add an additional level of on-receipt-
responses is called FLASH for these new not-quite emergencies.  This 
function is one step under the EMERGENCY BEEPING, and adds an 
unmistakeable SILENT FLASH  of "something" that an attendant operator 
cannot miss.

EXAMPLES:

!DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW$!PRIORITY! Special Event in progress
!DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW$PHG3530!PRIORITY! Special Event in progress

;OBJCTNAME*DDHHMMzDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW$!PRIORITY! Special Event...
;OBJCTNAME*DDHHMMzDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW$PHG3530!PRIORITY! Special...

This proposal is fully backwards compatible with all existing systems
in that the free-field bytes are used.  Hence they will at least
display on all known existent systems.  

However, since this is an APRS1.2 Addendum Proposal, there is no 
expectation of any functional backward compatibility or guaranteed 
response to these special coded fields in any prior software.

Hence use of this proposed feature should only be expected on pre-
tested end-to-end future systems.
