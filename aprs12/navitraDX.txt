NAVITRA to APRS J-Gate DRAFT SPECIFICATION                  8 Apr 2003
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 WB4APR

This spec suggests a mechanism for exchanging 
messages and data between APRS users and Japanese NAVITRA users via the
worldwide APRS Internet System.  NAVITRA is an AX.25 Mobile position
reporting system used in Japan on their domestic model D7 and D700 
equivalent radios.  Although it has no specific messaging capability, 
it does have the same 40 character DX-LIST that we have in our radios.
Thus we can convert APRS messages to something they can receive.

They can communicate back using the 20 character text in their position
reports or eventually start using APRS client software to send standard
APRS messages.

By definition, all packets on the APRS-IS will be APRS formatted.  
Japanese users desiring to view this data on the actual internet will use 
normal APRS client software.  This spec defines only how packets cross 
the NAVITRA(RF)-to-APRS(IS) interface before being sent to or from the
APRS-IS.  I will call this a "JGate" to distinguish it from an "Igate"
although they are otherwise identical processes in client software.
In other words, how NAVITRA RF packets will be converted to 
APRS format and how APRS packets will be converted to NAVITRA on RF.

POSITION DATA:  This is easy.  JGate authors simply add the $PNTS
NAVITRA format to their list of existing APRS formats they parse.  This
simple step immediately makes an APRS program NAVITRRA compliant as
far as being able to monitor RF in Japan and the worldwide APRS-IS.
This is the EASY and the MOST REWARDING step in integrating NAVITREA
users into APRS.  If authors put $PNTS into all their software, then
even visiting Japanese hams elsewhere int he world can be seen on
APRS!

MESSAGES:  APRS messages that need to go through a JGate will be
converted to DX-LIST format before transmission back to RF in Japan.
This makes them receivable on any D7 and D700 in Japan.  ALthough
the mobile user in Japan cannot send back a message or DX list format,
NAVITRA users can communicate with each other by adding ">TOCALL" 
at the end of the 20 byte text.  Sometimes only a callsign suffix is 
used ">XXX".  This should be easy to identify and parse back into a
brief APRS message at the JGate.


POSITION DATA NAVITRA(RF)-TO-APRS(IS):  
--------------------------------------

But before we get into the details of the text or "message" bytes, we must 
first define the standard conversion for position data.  In the NAVITRA
data, there is only ONE packet format.  BUT it has a single byte "I"
which can indicate the "type" of position report as shown below.
It can either be the station's present position, a Waypoint, a Starting 
point or an Ending point.  But almost all packets are of the "O" type.  
The others are RARELY used:

NAVITRA FORMAT:   $PNTS,V,I,DD,MM,YYYY,HHMMSS,LAT,N,LONG,W,$

Here is then how to convert the $PNTS to APRS format based on the "I"
byte:

APRS(I=0): @DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$CSE/SPD/xxxxxx...    A posit
APRS(I=S): ;XXX-START*DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$xxxxxx...  Start Pt
APRS(I=E): ;XXX-END  *DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$xxxxxx...  End Pt
APRS(I=I): ;XXX-WAYPT*DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$xxxxxx...  Waypoint
APRS(I=P): ;XXX-OBJCT*DDHHMMzDDMM.HHN/DDDmMM.hhW$xxxxxx...  Object

Where XXX is the sending station's callsign suffix.  These suffixes are 
only used as the object NAME in the object formats.


J-GATE NAVITRA to APRS-IS MESSAGE FORMAT:
-----------------------------------------

Common usage in Japan has users placing ">TOCALL" at the end of any 
position text when it is intended for another station.  Sometimes this 
is only a sufFIX.  Our conversion is easy.

1) If the ">TOCALL" exists, then TOCALL becomes the APRS message address
   and the TOCALL is added to a TOCALL-buffer in the JGate
2) If ">xxx" is 3 bytes and it matches the suffix of a call in the 
TOCALL-buffer then it is sent to that call.  If there is no match, then
it is sent to ALL with the entire 20 bytes included in the message as is... 
Here are the examples that we can use for APRS conversions:

  
NAVITRA 20 byte TEXT  Converted to APRS FORMAT                     NOTES
--------------------  -------------------------------------------- ----------
message text >TOCALL  :TOCALL...:NAVITRA MSG: message text         Normal MSG
More message txt>XXX  :ALL......:NAVITRA MSG: More message txt>xxx Suffix msg
any other text, etc   [is not a message because the ">" is missing]

In these examples, the ">" character indicates it is a NAVITRA message 
for injection into the J-GATE.  WHat follows the ">" can be 4 things:

  >TOCALL    in this case, the conversion is to a personal message
  >XXX       In this case, the conversion is to a personal message
             or to ALL if there is no immediate match
  >#         This will be a Bulletin Number #
  >          This will be an Email

TOCALL is variable length, from 4 to 6 characters.  There is no provision 
for SSID, since just like in APRS, a message to the root call will be 
accepted by all SSID's of the same call.  And since there is no ACK 
capability in NAVITRA, then there is no reason to specify or require an 
exact SSID match.  


APRS(IS)-TO-NAVITRA(RF) Message Conversion:
--------------------------------------------

Going from APRS-IS to RF requires the J-Gate to convert it to DX-LIST
format.  This gives us a 30 to 40 character message capability.  But 
since there are no ACKS, the message is transmitted 'n' times and it 
times-out.  Here is how we can use the DX-list format to send messages 
to the Japanese model D7 and D700 in Japan:

D7 Display:   +--------------+     +--------------+
              | DxXYZ>ABCDEF |     | DxXYZ>ABCDEF |
              | 222222222_   |     |   3333333333 |
              |        [MSG] |     |   4444444444 |
              +--------------+     +--------------+

D700 Display: 
              +---------------------------+
              | 1:XYZ>ABCDEF**       [MSG]|
              |            222222222      |
              |   333333333344444         |
              |   444445555555555         |
              +---------------------------+

D700 DX-list: +---------------------------+
              | 1:XYZ>ABCDE 222222222[MSG]|  <== note only 5 chars of TOCALL
              +---------------------------+

URCALL>RESORC:DX de IGATECALL.222222222_XYZ>ABCDEF***33333333334444444444
              5555555555*[MSG]

Notice that all the fields are fixed length:
  IGATECALL  9 bytes valid call format
  2222...    This is 10 chars, but the last (_) is not shown on the D700
  XYZ>ABCDEF The FROM (suffix) and full TOCALL
  3333...    10 bytes of free text
  4444...    10 bytes of free text
  5555...    10 more bytes not shown on the D7

Notice that since this is an APRS-IS to RF conversion process, this 
process is only performed if the "TOCALL" of the message matches a 
locally received NAVITRA station just like any IGate.  But to allow
for an intial means to communicate with the small number of Japanese
using NAVITRA, there needs to be a backdoor.  THis will be via 
a bulletin such as BLN#JAPAN or BLN#NIHON.

NAVITRA GROUP CALLS:

There is another feature in NAVITRA that allows GROUP calls.  These can
be used to send packets to certain 3 digit groups.  We could use one
such GROUP call as a way to automatically pass APRS packets through
the JGate that are intended for JAPAN only.  The default wildcard is 
"000".  SO, for example, only bulletins originated on APRS 
specifically intended for NAVITRA users by these group calls would be 
J-Gated to RF in Japan.

I need to work on the GROUP code some more, because I am not sure
if it is only an outgoing indicator or if there is a filter on the
NAVITRA incoming...
