IGATE Feedback Packet on the IS==>RF Interface               30 Oct 08
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For the last decade, a weak-link in the end-to-end connectivity in
the overall APRS network has been the inconsistancy in the APRS-IS-
-back-to-RF interface.  Not only is it very dependent on particular 
IGate software, it is also completely dependent on individual user 
IGate settings.  This makes end-to-end APRS message delivery 
inconsitent, and unreliable.

We need the APRS message backbone to become the overall ham radio 
backbone for what we call "Universal Text-Messaging for Ham Radio".
The end user clients can be whatever the operator is using, be it
Winlink, an IPhone, a cell phone, a blackberry, or an APRS radio.
Every "system" used by ham radio operators that can send and display
text, we want to be integrated into this global/local text messaging
system.

Please see http://www.aprs.org/aprs-messaging.html

But first, we need to nail down this weakness at the IS ==> RF
interface.  We are proposing that all IGates that send a message
packet from the IS to RF (IS==>RF) should also then send back a 
report on the APRS-IS as to what it did with any message packet 
for which it should have been accountable.  As a minimum, this 
gate-status packet should contain:

1) The Igate's callsign.
2) A copy of the packet as it is sending to RF
3) An indicator of the RF path that it used
4) An indicator of the "rule" it used to Igate
5) Anything else?

We can use this information to troubelshoot the network.  From that,
we can better define the ultimate functionality for IGates and the
proper rules for operation.

PROPOSED FORMAT:

We will define a new packet format, since we cannot just stuff it 
into the PATH fields of the same packet, since it will be rejected 
as a dupe by all the other APRS-IS processes.  How about something 
like this:

IGATECALL>APXXXX,RULE:{IP-RF_PACKET_GOES_HERE

* Where APXXX lets us see the Igate software version
* RULE tells us what rule it used to decide to gate-to-RF
* {IP- is the experimental format for this new Igate-Path format
* RF_PACKET_GOES_HERE is the packet as it was transmitted on RF 

Rules for gating to RF might be things like:
 -Hd   meaning heard Direct
 -H1   heard via one hop
 -H2   heard via 2 hops etc
 -CL   Callsign List
 -LA   Local Area info

Something like that.  Then we can finally see what is happening
to messages (and maybe other IS==>RF packets "at the other end"!

ITEM-IN-MESSAGE ***

This is also related to the other new APRS1.2 proposal, to add
ITEM-IN-MESSAGE capability.  This is so that a sender anywhere
can send an object to a user in a remote location via the global
APRSnetowrk.  It is simply placing the ITEM format inside a message
to a recepient.  On receipt, that client software should display
that ITEM on its local map.  But here, this is an end-client new
feature and is not related to IGate code.

see  http://www.aprs.org/aprs12/item-in-msg.txt

Since these are message packets, we will also see how they are
handled as well.  But me-thinks that all client software should
read-the-mail and whenever it sees an ITEM-IN-MESSAGE in someone
elses traffic, it should go ahead and plot it for all users too.

This lets us send an important object to someone we are in 
communication with or everyone in range of a distant point in
which we are exchanging messages. These objects are of course,
identifiable as to their source, since it is in a message...
