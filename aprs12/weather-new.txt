APRS version 1.2.1 WEATHER UPDATES TO THE SPEC          24 Mar 2011
-------------------------------------------------------------------

24 Mar 2011  Proposed major simplification of new sensor approach
23 Mar 2011  updated Radiation Reporting Field
 6 Jan 2010  previous version

After the Japanese Nuclear incident in Mar 2011, we realized we 
needed a radiation sensor field in the APRS weather format.  But in
2006 we had already added Flood gages and Flooding symbols.  
Apparently on Firenet where these water gage symbols appear, they
are all not using the weather format but are using this format:

;09428508 *061713z3401.40N/11424.75Ww3.57gh/82cfs

This March 2011 we have proposed a change to simplify new sensors 
as follows:

1) All weather data (and any new sensor data) will be transmitted
using one of the existing WX parsable symbols: *_, where "*"
is now used as a wildcard meaning any of the table characters or
overlays.  

2) All HAZARD symbol categories will also be parsed for weather
and other sensor formatted data.  This is because, once a condition
has exceeded a threshold, that station/sensor can change its 
symbol to indicate that HAZARDOUS condition.  So this includes *H
symbols.  

3) The 2006 Water gage format noted above will not change, since it 
has no impact on the weather sensor format.  The 2006 proposal for
water gages did include a format for inclusion in weather data, and
that format is still valid, but will ONLY be parsed for in otherwise
valid weather data formats.  The special water gage and flooding
symbols /w and \w introduced in 2006 will not be parsed for weather
data as originally proposed.

Changes implicated by the above will be updated in all APRS files
that I can find.  Such as:

http://aprs.org/aprs11/symbols.txt
http://aprs.org/aprs12/watergage.txt   

Readers should also review all the clarifications to
the original spec made in the APRS1.1 addendum in this document:

http://aprs.org/aprs11/spec-wx.txt

This new aprs12/weather-new.txt file will contain all proposed 
APRS1.2 additions to the WX format fields.  For the full APRS1.2
addendum, see http://aprs.org/aprs12.html

COMPLETE REPORT:  The use of the COMPLETE APRS weather format is
strongly encouraged where both position and weather data are included
in a single COMPLETE packet.  The use of the positionless weather
format is strongly discouraged since it is useless without position,
and the requirement for additional weather station position report
packets are equally useless without weather included in them!  It is
an anathma for a real time system such as APRS to split this data
among multiple unreliable packets.

RADIATION LEVEL:  The field Xxxx has been proposed for reporting the
level of Nuclear Radiation levels if available.  The X is the type
indicator.  We chose "X" for radiation.  The xxx are like the resistor
code.  First, two digits of precision and the last digit is the order
of magnitude in NANOSEVERTS/Hr.  So 123 is 12 * 10^3 nanosieverts/hr or
12 microsieverts/hr. Or 456 is 45 * 10^6 nanosieverts/hr or 45 
millisieverts/hr.  One bananna generates about .1 uSieverts/hr, 
a Brazil nut .4 uS/hr.

If the radiation is at background levels the /_ weather symbol may be 
used, when elevated readings occur, the R_ weather symbol with "R"
overlay will indicate a Radiation Sensor weather station.  When a
hazard threshold has been reached, the symbol can change to a RH
symbol (Hazard with R overlay).

WATER GAUGE INFO:

In June 06, water level gage info was added to APRS.  Two new 
symbols were introduced, one for H2O "/w" and the other for FLOOD "\w".  
The device can choose to send either of these symbols depending on its 
own threshold for "flooding".  The data format for these objects
appears to be: 

;09428508 *061713z3401.40N/11424.75Ww3.57gh/82cfs

Which is standard Object format with a text of "3.57gh/82cfs" meaning
gage height and cubic feet per second.

NEW:  We propose that water gage readings can also be included in
weather reports.  For benign water readings included with WX info
use the normal /_ weather symbol, unless the flood gage reading is
important when the F_ weather station with F overlay will be used.
When FLOOD conditions are reached, the symbol can change to a hazard
symbol (FH).

The height above or below flood or tide level in inches is included in 
the position comment string as Fxxxx and that string is chosen to be 
compatible with the standard APRS weather reporting parameters.  In 
addition, a voltage field Vvvv is also added. Thus, the usual APRS 
weather report string similar to:

  DIR/SPD/Gggg/Tttt/Rrrr/Pppp etc

is extended by adding these additional parameters for 

Fxxxx  water level above or below flood stage or mean tide in tenths
       of a foot.  Values can range between +999 and -999 in tenths 
       meaning -99.9 to +99.9 feet.  Meters are not used for the on
       air format because it gives too little or too much resolution
       to fit in the fixed length 4 bytes that are required.

Vxxx   battery volts in tenths   128 would mean 12.8 volts

Zxx    Device type

These fields can either be added to a WX station report where the WX
symbol would continue to be used, or the available weather data can
be added to a Water Gage report using either of the two water symbols.
The standard WX report allows for any field to be indicated as not
available either by omission or by replacing the value with "...".
SInce the wind direction and speed and temperature are required fields,
this means the minimum weather report with flood info is
   
WX symbol -plus-   .../...t...VxxxFxxxx

or the minimum water gauge report is

Water symbol -plus- VxxxFxxxx/ZFA

Notice that if water data is added to a WX report, then only Fxxxx
and optional Vxxx are added to the WX report.  But if WX data is
added to a water gage report, then the minimum fields of wind 
direction and speed and temperature .../...t...Fxxxx are required.

Examples are:

Weather Station reports with flood gage readings:

 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW_ddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/Fxxxx...
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW_ddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/Fxxxx/Vvvv...
 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW_ddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/Rrrr/PppppFxxxx...

Water Gage Object reports (w/o weather):

;09428508 *061713z3401.40N/11424.75Ww3.57gh/82cfs

Water Gage Object reports with weather:

 DDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhWwddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/FxxxxVvvv/ZFA

 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhW_FxxxxVvvv/ZFA

 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhW_ddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/FxxxxVvvv/ZFA
 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhW_ddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/FxxxxVvvv/ZFA

Flood Hazards(new):
 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhWHFxxxx/ZFA
 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhWHFxxxxVvvv/ZFA
 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhWHFxxxxVvvv/ZFA
 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhWHddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/Fxxxx/ZFA
 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhWHddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/FxxxxVvvv/ZFA
 DDMM.hhNFDDDMM.hhWHddd/sss/Gggg/Tttt/FxxxxVvvv/ZFA


Notice that since 2006, existing software had to also consider parsing
the appearance of any WATER or FLOOD symbols to see if they also
include Weather.  Also, everyone's weather parser needed to look
at the WX fields for the optional additional Fxxxx or Vvvv fields.

This has been simplilfied in addendum 1.2.1 so that only two APRS
symbol groups need to be parsed for Weahter and other sensor data,
that is the original *_ and *W for weather plus the new *H hazards.

Parsing the old water gage data may be required until all legacy
water gages are gone.?  Comments?
