</center>
<P>

<B>Present:</B> Anapolis Friends Meeting has been in at least 2 years of negotiation with our friendly neighbor over opportunities on his land.  During this time of uncertainty we have not promoted the interfaith trail and also remained low key due to some expressed concerns by the Unitarians over some possible strangers dealing drugs in their parking lot.  So we are just idling along, maintaing our trail and keeping the doors open.  We enjoin others to keep their trail ideas open and alert us to any possible problems.

<P>

<B>Cleanup 2014</B>,
was organized by the Severn River Association.

The areas of work were in the <A HREF="AFM/trails/CofG-junk0248x.jpg"><B> ravine</B></A>
behind Washington Drive and at the ends of Dubois and Lawrence Avenues.  The

<B>Luce Creek Watershed:</B> In our busy daily lives as we zoom up and down Bestgate Road
and the streets of the neighborhoods,
we are hardly aware of the large wilderness area behind the trees as shown above.
Many of the adjacent property owners including nearly a dozen faith and youth based
communities have a desire to maintain the sanctity of this
natural area. 
It is helpful to look at this area from the perspective of
an overall watershed system instead of just the abandoned back corners of nearly 50 property owners.
<A HREF="AFM/trails/property-map.gif"><B>See the actual property map</B></A> to see the
small number of actual properties that have to be involved and the number of openspaces already possibly available.   
Also see a 
<A HREF="AFM/trails/LuceCreekAreaMap.jpg"></B>map prepared by the Unitarians</B></A> back in 2010.
One large parcel in the area is Margrets Glen which is currently under development for 
<A HREF="AFM/trails/MargretsGlen.jpg"><B> 14 new 1-2 acre home sites</B></A>.
Five of these lots will abut the Luce Creek valey but a large part of that property
is zoned as open space.
See how they overlay <A HREF="AFM/trails/MargaretsTrees2007-lines-trails-b.jpg"><B> on the aerial image</B></A> and provide access to the synagogue to the creek area.

<B>Interfaith Environmental Trail:</B> One way to maintain the integrity of this natural watershed area is to connect our preservation
efforts with a nature trail.  We have suggested calling this the Luce Creek Interfaith Environmental Trail and
have sketched some ideas on the map above.  Green areas indicate property owners already involved
in maintaining their portion of the trail.  Yellow lines are hopeful areas. Red notes highlight some of the significant environmental protection projects also listed at the right. 
  
Another section of the potential trail is in the Southeast corner of
the above map.  This area can potentially connect St John Neumann's, the Weems Creek Baptist Church and
possibly the Presbyterians.  You can see a possible
<A HREF="AFM/trails/Interfaith-Trail-Knights.jpg"><B> route in detail, here</B></A> showing the UU's Geothermal Wells and Catholic water management ponds. 
  In the Luce Creek ravine, the trail needs occasional trimming of invasive greenbriar patches and maintenance of the foot bridges over muddy areas. The trail in the area connecting to the Bestgate Park and Church of God seemed to be in fine shape as
<A HREF="AFM/trails/Hike3-10-2014x.jpg"><B> shown here</B></A>.

<P>
<B>Issues and Concerns:</B> This is not a group work party effort since we do not want to appear to
be exploiting the wilderness area but only to join together in concern over its protection.  We simply
want to recognize our connecting, adjacent properties and share in the overall upkeep of the area.
There should be no <A HREF="AFM/trails/liability-opinion.gif"><B>liability concerns</B></A>, since
this is nothing more than maintaining our mutual trails like we maintain sidewalks.  The trail is not
<B><i> public</B></i> but simply ours collectively.
<P>

<P>
<B>Annapolis Area Trails:</B>  To show how this natural area fits within the greater
Annapolis area and county system of trails, we have circled our location
on the map below in green and sketched the main trail. 
In particular from Bestgate Park the three main annapolis trails are
accessible, the South Shore Trail towards Crownsville, the B&A trail across the
Severn and up towards Baltimore, and the Colonial Annapolis Trail.

<P>

<B>AFM and Unitarian Environmental Efforts:</B>  The rest of this page covers the detail 
on the AFM and Unitarian portions of the trail.  We are happy to add sections or links for other 
groups' efforts.

<P>
Over the past decade, the Annapolis Friends Meeting and Unitarians have long been involved in
protecting the natural beauty of this area between Dubois and Lawrence roads
with nature trails as shown below.  
Although the south side of the creek
has been a dumping ground for most of the last century, most of it is grown over.  Several
annual clean ups have been sponsored by the Unitarians, Quakers,
Severn River Keepers and even some Naval Academy midshipmen.  Each event results in
the removal of tons of junk and surface debris from old cars and appliances
and thousnad of broken bottles.

<B>Some History and a Photo Walk of the Trail:</B>
Annapolis Friends Meeting is concerned for the environment and began a number of
<A HREF="AFM-environment.html"><B> efforts in this regard.</B></A>  
Back in June 2011 we were having meetings
in consideration of 
adjacent properties and how to protect the wilderness.  
We realized that it might be nice to have a photo tour
of some of the trails that our AFM kids have used in communing back and forth
with the Unitarians.  

<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/AFMravineTrailsABC.JPG" Align=right>

This web page
attempts to capture this small protion of the trail shown here.
Our own trail system that circles our lot and connects into the Luce Creek Trail system
goes
off the map to the right and circles around down into the Luce Creek ravine
and comes back up behind our solar panels.
 The trails on this page are just a small part of the overall 
system of trails that our kids and other youth have discovered through the Luce Creek Watershed.
We invite other churches to join in this <B>Luce Creek Interfaith Trail</B> system.
<A HREF="AFM/trails/LuceCreek-watershed-trails.jpg"><B>Click here to see an overall map</B></A>.
This page has been updated in February 2014 as we enter spring and hopefully some trial work.

<P>
<B> Existing Unitarian and Quaker trails:</B>
Currently access to the AFM trail is from the hallway door and out the sidewalk 
to the east as shown below[A].  As seen on the map to the right, the trail proceeds along
our eastern property line down into the ravine (D) and up the other side.  There (at E) it turns
left towards the Unitarians.  The trails in our ravine encroach slightly on adjacent property
owners and we hope to correct that in the future.

<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/AFMwalkXx.JPG">
<P>
<B>Begin :</B> From our meeting house and the end of the sidewalk we walk past our memorial garden 
on the right and down into the woods as shown below[B].
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/AFMbeginX.JPG">
<P>
<B>Past our Memorial Garden :</B> This trail above heads on a gentle slope down into the ravine[C].
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/AFMpathaX.JPG">
<P>
<B>Down the Hill:</B> The path is left adjacent to our eastern property line and passes
between two large tulip Poplars at the bottom of the ravine.  Notice that the creek bed is 
completely dry at this end of the property[D].  Just prior to this photo is the turn to
the right that gets you onto our circular trail down into our ravine, across the creek,
then down into the Luce Creek ravine and then back up at the end of Dubois Road behind
our solar panels.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/AFMpathc1x.JPG">
<P>
<B>Climbing the Other Bank:</B> These 25 steps carry you up the other side to the top of the hill 
and into a wooded clearing in the southern most corner of our lot.
You enter this area from the left of 
the view below[E].  Since this location is a major trail junction in the
Luce Creek wilderness area, we have <B><i>simulated</B></i> some possible trail signs to show the distances
to the other Churches and Youth areas.  The sign on the left is pointing back the way you came
since you need to be on our circular trail to get to the main trail down in the Luce Creek
valley.
 But, before heading towards the Unitarians you
can pivot to the right to see some more views.
<P>
<B>Simulated Signs:</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/AFMpathdXx.JPG">
<P>
<B>Point Pleasant:</B> This is not our poperty and we should stay out of this area.
We hope to put up some kind of aesthetically pleasing indication that this property
is private and should be respected. Looking opposite from the direction of the Unitarian path (above)
you can see a very large tree with a hole under it (below)[F].  Behind this tree from the left
is a dip from our neighbor's private property down into the ravine (to the right.
The outline of our meeting house is shown with a yellow line.

<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/NewtreeholeX.JPG">
<P>
<B>The View to AFM:</B> 
Looking further to the right almost back from whence you came, you can see the AFM
building brick colors seeping through the trees in the ravine 
and the light from the treeless area of our AFM property.  The winter view of the
AFM meeting house will be in the area highlighted here with a yellow box.  In the lower center of
this view is a yellow line strung across the ravine whre a dream bridge could be built
<A HREF="http://aprs.org/AFM-walkway.html"><B>(see walkway page)</B></A>.
Again, the yellow box outlines the AFM building which is hard to see through the trees[G].
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/NewtoAFMx.JPG">
<P>
<B>Continuing Towards the UU's:</B> Completing your 360 degree turn to the right, where
teh simulated signs are located, you can then proceed down the path towards
the Unitarian Trail System[H].
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUpathzX.JPG">
<P>

<B>Overall Area Map:</B> At this point it might be a good idea to take a look at an overall map 
(bottom of page) of the entire
area to help you get your bearings.  The large image below covers all the trails between
the Unitarians and AFM.  Notice, that the area behind our meeting house belongs to our neighbor and should not
be used. This map does show our AFM circular trail.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/AFM-area-map-marks.JPG">
<P>
This path from that four-corners area extends eastward (to the left in this southern view) 
probably 100 yards towards the Unitarians[I].
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUpathtoQx.JPG">
<P>
<B>The Unitarian Nature Trail:</B> Once into the Unitarian Trails System you will notice many trees are marked with
nature trail placards and can see an occasional bench for the foot weary as shown below[J].

<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUtrees-path-benchX.JPG">
<P>
<B>The Unitarian Field:</B> A side path to the south opens up into the nice green field that marks the western end
of the Unitarian property and is open to Lawrence Ave.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUintofieldX.JPG">
<P>
 This field marks the western end of the existing Unitarian property.  On the
far side of this field is the shared property line with the new property
that is currently for sale.  The right end of that property line
runs into the AFM eastern property line.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUgazeboX.JPG">
<P>
<B>The Gazebo:</B> Turning back to the east, you come to a path to a gazebo in the woods.  This
seems to make a nice quite place to have a meeting or gathering.  For any
future ideas for AFM, I might suggest a structure with a translucent roof
so that the light can shine in.  The tree canopy provides plenty of shade
for the structure, so the roof is only need to protect from rain.  A central
fire place could extend the useable seasons of such a structure.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUpathfmGx.JPG">
<P>
<B>The Trail to the UU's:</B> Turning back from the gazebo, the trail winds through the woods towards their
building compex.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUpathtogardenX.JPG">
<P>
<B>The Memorial Garden:</B> The paths eventually come out into the Unitarian Memorial Garden above.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUlabrynth-peopleX.JPG">
<P>
<B>The Labrynth:</B>  But first if you turn to the left you can see their Labrynth.  The first time I walked
through, I saw a kid patiently tracing his way thorugh the maze.  Later when I came
back with my camera, I found this family sitting in the middle of the Labrynth.  The UU's
have an annual Summer Program for kids called 
<A HREF="http://www.uuca-md.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=177&amp;Itemid=118"><B>Camp Beagle</B></A>
that involves kids outdoors learning about the environment.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AFM/UUgardenaX.JPG">
<P>
<B>The UU's Garden and Deck:</B> 
Turning back to the right and entering the Memorial Garden gives a good view of their
memorials and one end of their church building.  If you continue to the left up and across the
Unitarian parking lot the trail enters the Catholic Church area and from there it could
proceed across Dubois, behind the Knights of Columbus and then onto the Baptist's land
and across Ridgley onto the Presbyterians as shown below:
<P>


------------------------------------------------------------

We have played with lots of imaginary ideas such as a far future project to visualize a possible
<A HREF="http://aprs.org/AFM-walkway.html"><B> elevated walkway</B></A>
 across the ravine.
