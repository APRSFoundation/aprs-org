I also created an underlay with the JPG map.  For anyone using UI-View 
and PMapServer 7, they could convert the JPG to BMP format and create 
a calibration file for it. The filename should be the same as the BMP 
file (minus the BMP) and with an extension of SAT. The content of the 
SAT file would be...

-077.37683,38.1645,-077.30133,38.12166

It's "top left / bottom right" in degree decimal format.

The advantage of PMapServer 7 and having it as an underlay instead of 
a static map is that they can pan / scroll / zoom... whether they zoom 
out to see the whole continent, just the nearest towns, or areas 
immediately adjacent to the underlay. Of course, to be able to make 
use of the details shown in the underlay, they will need to be zoomed 
in so the underlay covers the whole screen or even a bit more.

You could convert the JPG to BMP format and make it available along 
with the file JAMBOREE-APRSMAP50.SAT (with the above "calibration"
information in it) for use by those that are using PMapServer. The
instructions could be...

* Download Jamboree-APRSmap50.BMP
* Download Jamboree-APRSmap50.SAT
* Save both files in the UNDERLAYS folder below the PMapServer 7
   installation folder.

For those that have never loaded an underlay before, the steps to
actually use the underlay would be to click on...

* MAP
* Control Panel (only be visible if you are running PMapServer)
* Underlays
* Load Underlay
* Select the underlay and click on OK
* click on EXIT

Basically, UI-View users would have the choice of using the JPG as a
static map, or as an underlay (scrollable and zoomable) if they are
using PMapServer 7. If they aren't, their only choice would be to use
the JPG as a static file.
