           DTMF Radio Capabilities for APRStt            (rev b) 30 Nov 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this document is to document the capabilities and ease-of-use 
of DTMF in all popular radios.   For the purpose of APRStt, it is assumed 
that any preparation work has already been done to place the radio in an 
optimum configuration that then subsequently facilitates the sending of DTMF.
For example, the Kenwoods have an exhaustive MENU key, but in this case, it 
is assumed that the MENU key has already been cycled to the DTMF memory 
function during DTMF operations so that all subsequent use of that key is 
already in DTMF MEMORY mode.

[Optional steps] are shown in brackets.

*Detailed DTMF info by Daniel, KB3MUN: http://aprs.org/aprstt/DTMF-China.html
*Also, WOXUN Report from Byon:

Using KG-UV3D memory config software from Powerwerx on my Wouxun KG-UV3D. https://www.powerwerx.com/wouxun/usb.html )

Can store from 1 to 6 DTMF tones.  All 16 DTMF keys allowed.  Manual only says
0-9 and A-D, but * and # can also be stored.  The ANI tones were sent each 
time after pressing PTT.  There were no "signal codes", or any other DMTF 
memory features I could see.  Reception was not affected by enabling ANI.  ANI
is only settable via the config software, not the radio keypad.

The ABCD keys are the top row of keys labeled as MENU, UParrow, DN arrow, EXIT

The CHIRP software has no references to ANI or DTMF for the Woxun (or Baofeng)
