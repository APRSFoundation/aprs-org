*** THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL APRStt SPEC ***

*** that we are currently developing  ***
*** in 2009 for windows.              ***

APRStt is a gateway between conventional Packet APRS and a separate 
simplex voice channel where APRStt users can "log-in" to APRS using only
their DTMF key pad and where they get voice responses informing them of
significant APRS information in their area.

APRStt VERSION 0.2  INTRODUCTION:

The original APRStt was a local Touchtone/Voice interface to APRS.  It 
ran on any old DOS PC with standard LPT1 and COM1 ports.  It required an
external hardware DTMF decoder and an 8-resistor D/A for voice.  It was
last updated 8 Nov 2002.  File name is aprstt-old.txt.  All the files
were in APRStt.zip

Voice-Only.  Even without any DTMF input data from any APRStt users, the
APRStt gateway can give unsolicited voice comments on items of local
interest.  Examples implemented in APRStt1.0  were:

  1) It would speak the movements of special stations.
     A) Any TH-D7 using the  TRIANGLE ICON
     B) Any D700 or any other APRS mobile using the "/n" ICON
     C) Any one station commanded by the APRStt operator (or DTMF user)
  2) Speak the AZ and EL and Frequency of any satellite in view
  3) Speak the TRAFFIC Speed past any TRAFFIC choke point that is
     listed in the TRAFFIC.POS file.  This is for daily commuters.
     See TRAFFIC.TXT

Using APRStt in this manner is great for a RACE or other event with one
or only a few special calls that everyone needs to track.  Just put APRStt
on a simplex frequency and ALL HT users can listen in...
------------

APRStt was first demonstrated at Dayton 2002 and voice was added by RAC
2002 in Vernon B.C. 

APRStt DESCRIPTION:

An APRStt local server consists simply of a standard APRS Packet
TNC/Radio on the Comm port and another radio with audio connectinos
to the Voice and Data lines on the APRStt interface to the LPT1 port.
The packet side operates on the 144.39 or other APRS channel and the
other radio operates on the local APRStt VOICE channel.  NOTICE, a D7
or D700 can serve both purposes, thus, one laptop-one-radio complete.

This APRStt spec provides for a standard TTone-to-APRS and APRS-to-Voice
conversion format so anyone, anywhere can send and receive APRS messages,
position reports, Objects and Queries with only an HT/Mobile with a TTone
pad and can hear voice responses.  The ability of APRStt to allow every-
one with a simple HT to participate in data entry and to monitor APRS
moving objects opens up many new possibilities for the user of APRS to
support special events.  Here are several examples:

1) My kids can use an $88 HT to send messages to Dad's Taxii service,
   ("get me at 5").  Or to query where I am (QRD*WB4APR)

2) You can send EMAIL from any DTMF HT.

3) Mobiles/Portables at an event can report their position anywhere or
   in the "vicinity" of reference points with only 3 or 4 digit entries.
   The entry "B*#013" puts them in the vicinity of mile 13 (with a half
   mile ambiguity).

4) Any tracker, station or Object can be set for automatic APRStt voice
   reporting as each new posit comes in on APRS.

   NOTE:  APRStt reports all positions as a DIRECTION and DISTANCE to
   other known reference locations (not lat/long).

5) A blind APRS user at RAC suggested he could set his D7 band A to
   APRS as a conventional APRS tracker and listen to APRStt on band B
   and now he would know his OWN position.  Normally, everyone else
   knows where he is, but not himself.

6) APRStt can be set to announce the AZ and EL of any APRS (or other)
   satellite when it comes in view.. APRSdata.exe already puts these
   APRS Satellite objects on 144.39.  The command to activate Voice
   announcements is simply "AA" to "Activate Amsats".

7) APRStt also has traffic monitoring capability and can report by voice
   the speed of traffic by certain local traffic choke points.

The abbreviated short format definintions of APRStt combined with the
TTone memories built-in to most radios allows for nominal APRS operations
with only a few key strokes.  In fact, the number of key strokes can
actually be less than for a Kenwood APRS radio message!

Further more, there are many non APRS HT's that were built in the
1990's that can receive Touch Tone alphanumeric messages.  APRStt can
forward APRS messages from 144.39 to these HT's just as easily as to
a THD7 by using DTMF for these radios:  (this feature is not yet done)

    Kenwood TH-28A, TH-48A, TH-78A
    Yeasu   FT-11R, FT-41R, FT-51R
    Icom    W31A


This APRStt system is implemented on a single PC listening for tones on
your normal voice repeater or on a simplex frequency usually up in
the 147.5 MHz range (147.555).  The APRStt engine decodes the DTMF
commands and responds to queries or re-formats the received TTone
digits into an APRS packet.  After confirmaiton of correctness by the
user, then APRStt sends the data out on 144.39 as a normal APRS packet.
For feedback to the user and for sending APRS messages back to the
APRStt user, the PC uses synthesized voice.

APRStt KeyPad:
--------------

All APRStt formats are based on the familiar 16 button DTMF keypad
found on almost all HAM radios.  These keys, 0-9, *,#, and A,B,C,D are
used for all entries.  For commonality with the same keypads used on
the Kenwood APRS data radios, the assginments of the alphabet to those
keys and the fundamental definitions of the ABCD keys are kept as
close as possible to the APRS Kenwood design shown below:

+------------------+  This figure shows the standard Touch Tone Key pad
| 1    2    3   A  |  with its standard Alphabetic alternate definitions.
| QZ  ABC  DEF --> |  These definitions match those on the Kenwood also
| 4    5    6   B  |  used for APRS message entry.  For Alphabetic text
|GHI  JKL  MNO <-- |  entry, the letter A would be one press of the "2"
| 7    8    9   C  |  key, B would be "22" and C would be "222".  To enter
|PRS  TUV  WXY del |  the digit "2" within text, it would be "2222". If
| *    0    #   D  |  two adjacent letters use the same key, then press
|    space     OK! |  the "A" key between them.  The # key does all
+------------------+  punctuation in the order ?!'.,-/ etc

PRECURSOR "#" KEY:  When APRStt is at a voice repeater and listening
to the repeater input for tones, it must share the audio with the
existing COMMAND decoder.  Therefore, all APRStt sequences must be
preceeded with a key that tells the command decoder to ignore all
remaining tones. In most repeater controllers, this is the # key.  Thus,
we can use it as the start of all APRStt  sequences to force the normal
repeater to ignore the remainder of the APRStt sequence.  To APRStt,
leading #'s are ignored.

EDITING KEYS:  APRStt uses the A, B, C and D keys as special format
identifiers when they are the leading character in a field.  But whenever
they occur within an alphanumeric field, then they also take on these
editing definitions:

  A - Letter separator.  It is used between sequential letters that share
      the same number digit to tell APRStt to move on to the next one.
  B - Is a backspace character which deletes the previous character
  C - is a universal CANCEL or ABORT for the whole APRStt text
  D - Is the OK, or ENTER key.


APRStt FORMATS:  There are only four basic APRStt formats, Call, Position,
Message and Query.  The senders call is included in the CALL format to
identify the sending station for either a position or a message.
The CALL format includes the call and other unchanging data, the
ICON and Comment text.  The position format can be used for not only
station position, but also for objects.  Messages can be between APRS
stations or Email.  Queries ask APRStt for information about other users.

With these fundamental types and the numerous sub formats and short-cuts
APRStt becomes a very powerful APRS communications entry system and
APRS data server.  Each of these four entry formats begin with one of
the four special touch tone keys "A","B", or "C" and they all end
with a "D".

CALL: Acccc.*II*comment...D  - A,MYCALL,ICON,position comment
POS:  BLL.*LL.D              - B,LATITUDE,LONGITUDE (or shortcuts)
MSG:  Ctttt.*message...D     - C,TOCALL,message text
QRY:  QTMtttt.D              - Q,TYPE,MODIFIER,CALLSIGN

In all cases where a packet will be generated, the users entry is
announced, but the packet is held in a temproary buffer.  It will not
be sent on the APRS channel, 144.39 until the user sends "OK" on his
keypad (the digits 65) and ends it with the usual "D".  Example:

  * A brand new user enters his full call.
  * A 10 mile ambiguity posit is prepared for him around the APRStt loc
  * If he enters OK, it is sent.  If not, it is held
  * If he next enters a better posit, then the new resulting packet
    overwrites the pending packet and the new one is held.
  * If he now enters OK, then it is sent.

HASHING:  An important concept in APRStt is hashing.  Hashing in this
context means simply entering a single digit equivalent for each alpha-
numeric character instead of the exact 2, 3, or 4 key press alphanumeric
definition. Then APRStt will try to use syntax and heuristics to try
to figure out the most probable meaning for a given entry.  In other-
words the exact way to spell WB4APR is 922444427A77 but in most cases,
just using one key press per letter or hitting 0924277 will be a unique
enough number that only matches WB4APR in your area without ambiguity.
In the hashed example, the leading "0" implies the callsign is a HASH
and not exact.  In APRStt two major fields are usually hashed,
Callsigns and ICons.

In any CALLSIGN field, the presence of a leading "0" indicates that
the callsign is hashed otherwise it is decoded as a full alphanumeric
entry.  APRStt decodes hashed calls easily, because it is listening to
the APRS channel and maintains a list of all calls heard in the local
area.  On receipt of a DTMF hashed callsign, it will resolve the match
to the correct callsign using these rules:

1) For the "FROM" field, only callsigns that have been previously entered
   via APRStt touchtones will be searched for a match.

2) For other calls, any callsign heard is compared to a hash entry.

3) If no match, or duplicate matches, a "QRZ" or WHO? is returned.

4) The SSID is indicated with "0xx" as being the equivalent of "-xx".
   A callsign ending in "0" or with no "0xx" is assumed to be the
   root call except as noted in number 5 following:

5) For "FROM" callsigns, the lack of any SSID will imply "-11" as
   the default for all APRStt users.  An ending "0" is required to
   force the root call.

6) If only a root call (hashed) is used for a TOCALL of a message,
   and there is no exact match to the hash in the currently heard
   list, then the most recently heard SSID for that call will be used
   as the on-air packet call for the message and no error is returned.
   This ambiguity is permissible, becasuse all APRS client software
   is supposed to capture APRS messages to any of it's SSID's.
   The only requirement for an exact match is for the purpose of ACKS.
   And since APRStt does not send DTMF' acks back to the user, this is
   not critical and the message will be captured by all SSID's of that
   station currenlty on the air.


RESPONSES:
----------

APRStt responds to user entries using voice to validate the users entry
and to respond to his actions:

 CW  Voice       DTSS    MEANING
 --- ----------  ------  -------------------------------------------------
 QRZ no match    WHO?    User callsign not yet received
 R   callsign    OK      Sent following an understood entry
 K   tbd         Over    Sent as a prompt for next entry
 ?   bad call    What?   Entry not understood (Doesnt have numeral, etc)
 W   no match    Who?    No matching callsign (if referenced)
 ... match error Dupe?   Hash is ambiguous.  Spell out the full call
 BT  tbd         Break.  APRStt timed out, canceled CALL, ready...
 M   message     Msg     Message
 CQ  CQ message  CQ      Message to ALL received
 B   B message   Bulln   Bulletin (will be "bulletin")
 EM  email       Email
 ARL ARRL nn     ARRL    ARRL## Radiogram
 P   posit       POS     Position
 L   near posit  POS##   Reference Location
 C   near call           Relative Position near CALLSIGN


RESPONSES:  These responses are sent in response to an APRStt entry.  For
positions and locations, the LAT/LONGs are not spelled out but reported
as a direction and distance from known reference points.  These known
reference points are usually the APRStt device itself, the local club
repeater, the local digipeater, "downtown", the last-referenced object
or another referenced position.  This way, one can hear the relative
positions of stations or objects relative to each other.

When a New User enters his call, both the Reference position and the
Target position are defaulted to APRStt.  Once he has entered a new
position, then the defaults are to set to his location.


DIALOG WITH APRSTT:

Although APRStt was designed to convert DTMF to the four standard
APRS packet types, there are additional DTMF commands useful for the
user in his interacting with APRStt.  These are best remembered by
their HASH codes:

 ASD (273) Activate Sat Data    - Activate satellite voice data
 ATS (287) Activate TRACKER SPCL- Activate voice tracking of SPCL objects
 BYE (293) BYE                  - Log-off user (cancels his callsign)
 OK  (65)  OK                   - OK, send the pkt
 MM  (66)  Mile-Mark entry      - MMRD#nnn Road and Mile Mark number
 SA  (72)  Say Again            - repeat the last voice response
 SP  (77)  Say Packet           - say the packet pending (not yet OK'd)
 SLL (755) Say Lat/Long         - Say Ltitude and Longitude for target
 IT  (48)  Identify Target      - What is the current Target?
 IR  (47)  Identify Ref         - What is the current Reference?
 QRU (178) QRU                  - What is status of APRStt
 QRZ (171) QRZ                  - What is the current APRStt users call

 RESPONSES:

 CALL:    HELLO <CALL>
 MSG:     MESSAGE TO <CALL>  or EMAIL TO <spells out first word>
 POSIT:   <CALL> POSIT IS <DIRECTION> <DIST> FROM <ref>
 QUERIES:
   Callsign:  <target> IS <direction> <dist> MILES FROM <reference>
   Nearest:   NEAREST <type> IS <direction> <dist> MILES FROM <reference>
   Relative:  <target> IS <direction> <dist> MILES FROM <type>


NOMENCLATURE:  In this specification,  the following shorthand notation
is used in defining various formats:

    A,B, or C   - As leading characters, they define the APTStt formats.
                  Otherwise they are editing keys as noted above.
    D           - All entries end with D as the ENTER or OK key
    *           - The * is typically used as a data field separator
    #           - # as a trailing character on a command = HELP
    lower case  - means full alphanumeric text
    callsigns   - are full alphanumeric text but if they begin with a "0"
                  then the call is hashed.
    .           - a dot means variable length field
    UPPER case  - means a NUMERIC entry

CALLSIGNS:  Callsigns are either fully spelled out, or begin with a "0"
    and are hashed.  Further, since the APRStt user will usually need to
    use a different SSID to distniguish his call from his other APRS
    stations, APRStt will assume the default SSID of -11 for all APRStt
    users unless a specific one is entered.  To separate the SSID digits
    from the call, enter a "0".  To enter the root call only without SSID
    then enter only the 0.  To accept the default -11, leave off the 0.
    Here are some examples using my call:

    WB4APR-11   922444427A77     <== no SSID imples -11
    WB4APR-3    922444427A7703   <== all SSID's begin with a "0"
    WB4APR      922444427A770    <== forces -0 or no SSID
    WB4APR-11   0924277          <== The hashed version
    WB4APR-3    092427703        <== The hashed -3 call
    WB4APR      09242770         <== The hashed root call


CALLSIGN FORMAT VARIATIONS:
---------------------------
There are five variations on the CALL format and in each case, the callsign
may be fully spelled out, or hashed (with a leading "0").  For the first
time in an area you must always use a fully spelled out callsign so
that the local APRStt knows who you are.  From then on, you may hash it
and or enter the additional optional fields...

   Acccc.D               - A,MYCALL
   Acccc.*iiD            - A,MYCALL,ICON
   Acccc.*status...D     - A,MYCALL,status text
   Acccc.*ii*status...D  - A,MYCALL,ICON,status text
   Acccccc#hAAAOOOD      - Special 16 digit Call/Posit format for space

The ICONS are an optional two digit alphabetic abbreviation of the same
16 icons that are in the Kenwoods.  See section on ICons later.  It is
distinguished from a "status" field because it is exactly 2 digits long.
On receipt of an CALL packet, with no prior information on file, then a
position packet will be generated showing a position within the vicinity
of the LAT/ LONG of the APRStt engine but with a 10 mile ambiguity.
This puts you on the worldwide APRS "map" as being in the area of this
APRStt server.


POSITION FORMATS:  Position Reports consist of one or two fields,
Bxxx*xxx with meaning determined by the first character and length of
the fields as follows:

 B*cccc.         - In vicinity of station cccc...
 B#nnn           - In vicinity of numbered LOCation "nnn"
 BMMRD#nnn       - Road and Mile Mark number

 Ba     *cc      - sets Ambiguity and position comment
 Bmm    *mm      - Minutes  (nearest mi +/- 30mi fm APRStt)
 Bdmm   *dmm     - Degree/minutes (nearest mi +/- 300 mi fm APRStt)
 Bmmhh  *mmhh    - L/L MM.HH exact posit +/- 30mi fm rptr          ..
 Bddmmhh*dddmmhh - L/L exact position..(N,S,E,W same as APRStt)

 AMBIGUITY:  0 = 0.1 mile       1   = 1 mile,       9 = 9 mile

 POSITION COMMENTS:  Comments are hashed from 1 to 3 digit entries:
    C (2) - Committed      S  (7)   - Special      C1 (21) - Custom 1
    E (3) - Enroute        RE (73)  - Returning    C2 (22) - Custom 2
    I (4) - In Service     PR (77)  - Priority     ...(2n) - Custom n
    O (6) - Off Duty       911(911) - Emergency    C6 (26) - Custom 6

LAT/LONG entries can be either exact, ambiguous or relative depending
on the number of digits entered.  The three LAT/LONG formats are:

 Bmm    *mm     *SD - Minutes  (nearest mi +/- 30mi fm APRStt)
 Bdmm   *dmm    *SD - Degree/minutes (nearest mi +/- 300 mi fm APRStt)
 Bmmhh  *mmhh   *SD - L/L MM.HH exact posit +/- 30mi fm rptr          ..
 Bddmmhh*dddmmhh*SD - L/L exact position..(N,S,E,W same as APRStt)
                *S  - The status byte is optional

REFERENCE POSITIONS:  You may refer to a nearby position such as
someone else's call or an object or a prepared map of locations.  In
this case, then the first field points to the object location or call
and the second field enters the position ambiguity of either 0.1, 1
or 10 miles using the digits 1,2 and 3.  One mile is the default.
A given ambiguity will remain with that station until changed.
The two reference formats are as follows:

 B*cccc.*X*SD - In vicinity of station cccc... (ambiguity X)
 B#Xnn*X*SD   - In vicinity of LOCation "Xnn"  (ambiguity X)

LOCATION DETAILS:  The provision for position by reference in support
of special events is where APRStt really shines.  The format B#Xnn
will place you in the vicinity of a location identified to APRStt as
LOCXnn.  This can be a preloaded file, OR it can be an OBJECT uploaded
to APRStt over the air in near real-time!  Imagine being able
to report the position of anyone or anything at your special
event by simply entering the 6 digits above on ANY HT.  Think of the
first digit (X) as a "table" and nn as being a given location from 1
to 99 in that table.  One table can be Checkpoints, Another can be
water stops, another can be MILE marks another can be food stops,
another can be local hotels, etc.

For example:
    B#103     - places you at checkpoint 3
    B#103*3   - places you enroute checkpoint 3
    B#103*73  - places you returning from checkpoint 3

For Dayton, the Hamvention brochure contains a list of hotel areas
numbered 1 through 13.  Just entering 7 TTones, will place you on the
map near your hotel.  If all spin-off night-meeting locations were
also listed in the Brochure with a number legend, then people could
just use there HT's without the bother of a GPS for tracking friends
around the city.   The main HARA buildings could be 001 to 009, the
hotels could be 101 to 120  The restaurants could be 200 to 230, etc...

MILE-MARK POSITION REPORTING:  This evolves from the Mile Mark position
plotting built into APRSdos (and now UIview) that allows anyone to
locate a mile mark on the map.  In APRStt, the entry BMMRD#nn will place
a station on the map in the vicinity of mile mark nn on road RD.  These
entries use the MM.ALL file derived from  the MILEMARK.DAT file included
in all copies of APRSdos and recently UIview.  The Difference between
these files is that MM.ALL contains both LAT and LONG for the reference
mile marks wheras MILEMARK.DAT only contained one or the other.

The MM.ALL file provided with APRStt is quite crude but covers most
interstates.  But you should customize entries for your area,
and copy the result to MM.DAT which is the file used by APRStt.
Each entry in the file is a long road segment giving the LAT/LONG of
the beginning and ending Mile mark.  APRStt then can interpolate to
any milemark in  between.  Since the purpose of mile marks are only
approximate positions to the nearest mile or so, only a few such straight
line segments can cover most interstates.

The entry MD50,0,43,LA1,LO1,LA2,LO2 covers the stretch of Maryland
Route 50 starting at mile mark 0 and going to mile mark 43.

Since APRStt is a local program, it only needs entries for roads within
RF range of APRStt.  So copy only the needed entries from the MM.ALL
file to your own local MM.DAT file, and save a BACKUP copy of it as
MM.MY in case something ever overwrites the MM.DAT file... or MM.SS
for your state SS.

Also, if there are no adjacent state ambiguities, you may also remove the
state abbreviation from the entry to save keystrokes for all DTMF users.
BUT if you need to retain the STATE abbreviation, you must convert them
to the DTMF equivalent numerical digit.  In my case, "MD50" becomes "6350".



MESSAGE FORMATS:  Messages all begin with the "C" key.  The second letter
is hashed (Q=1, B=2, E=3).  The shortcut Email assumes the recepient has
his Email Address in his own comment or status text.  If no Email address
is available, it is simply a message to his RF callsign.  An advantage
of APRStt is that it adds a time-stamp to the message automatically if
there is room but puts it on the end so that it does not detract from
the short screens on the D7.  The time stamp format also alerts the
recepient that the APRStt sender cannot receive a reply.

   CQ*msg      - CQ message to ALL
   Cccccc*msg  - Message to ccccc
   C#msg       - Subsequent lines to the same person.
   Cccccc*E msg- Message to ccccc sent to his email addr (if given)
                 (For APRStt, the E is hashed "3" for brevity.
   Cccccc*E P  - Email as above containing sender's present position.
   CBn*msg     - Bulletin number n
   CE*aaa msg  - EMAIL in the usual APRS format with address as 1st word


The MESSAGE format of APRS allows APRStt infinite expansion capabilities
for any kind of data reporting at any kind of event.  Thus, you can
define any message for your application.


SPECIAL DATA EXAMPLE:  A local HAM club provides radio support for
our local scout Klondike Derby.  At each checkpoint the HAMS report by
voice the checkpoint, the troop number and the score.  These are
laboriously hand scribed onto paper, then passed to a keyboard operator
that enters the data into a computer to tally the results in (long
delayed) real time.  I suggested APRS, but we cannot find enough
D7's or operators who know how to use them.

But with APRStt anyone with any HT can enter Ctttt*CKss where tttt is
the troop number, CK is the checkpoint and ss is the score.  There is
no need for human scribing, because the data (after becoming an APRS
packet) goes directly into the computer.


QUERIES TO APRSTT
-----------------

The APRStt Query allows the APRStt user to query for information about
data in the APRS system.    A Query begins with the hashed letter "Q"
which is of course the digit "1" on the TTone keypad and has two
following fields and a third optional callsign field.

 QUERY FORMAT:  QTM*cccc.D   - Q,TYPE,MODIFIER,CALLSIGN

The second field is the TYPE character and is a single digit hash for
the different types of Querys and the MODIFIER field is also hashed
as a modifier of that TYPE query.  The last field (optional) is for
a callsign or object name.   The use of the TYPE key and the MODIFIER
key allows for up to 99 different types of queries.

For most Queries, locations are given for a TARGET in terms of DIRECTION
and DISTANCE from a REFERENCE.

The 10 TYPES of Query are indicated by the first field of the Query.
Each of these can be thought of as ten different Tables of additional
Queries.  The # key in each category is like the HELP key and will
return the list of options for that TYPE.  Again all Queries are
documented by referring to their HASHED nomenclature.  In other words,
the query "QRZ" really is a press of the "171" keys followed by the
usual "D" Key.

The following are the major categories of QUERY.  Many are not yet
implemented.  Only the QUERY-NEAREST and QUERY-REFERENCE are mostly
complete.

    TYPE          KEY       DESCRIPTION of QUERY TYPES
    ------------- --------  ------------------------------------------
    Q             1         Returns the "state" of APRStt (SATS, SPCL)
    Qqz??         11 (QZ )  TBD
    QC - Club     12 (ABC)  Information relative to the local clubs
    QE - Event    13 (DEF)  Event related Queries
    QH - Help     14 (GHI)  returns HELP info
    Qjkl???       15 (JKL)  TBD
    QN - Nearest  16 (MNO)  NEAREST stn/obj (changes the TARGET)
    QR - Relative 17 (PRS)  Selects REFERENCE for Position of TARGET
    Qtuv???       18 (TUV)  TBD
    QW - Weather  19 (WXY)  returns the nearest WEATHER to you
    Q#            1#        Returns a HELP list of Qx options


NEAREST POSITION QUERIES:  These will return the call and position of
the nearest of a selected set of Target stations/object types.  In
most Queries concerning positions, a Query will respond with a direction
and distance between the "reference" position and the "target" position.
The reference position and target position are changed by the user, but
otherwise do not have to be included in each specific Query....  For
each new APRStt user, however, both the Target and Reference are set
to the APRStt default.  Once he enters his position, then both are
referenced to him.  Here are the definitons for the NEAREST Queries
(QNx or "16x"):


  NEAREST(16)     KEY (n)    NEAREST STN/OBJ TO THE REFERENCE POS
  -------------   ---------  ------------------------------------------------
  QNQ - QTH       161 (Qz )  nearest fixed station
  QNabc???        162 (abc)  TBD
  QND - Digi      163 (Def)  nearest digipeater
  QNI - IRLP      164 (ghI)  nearest IGATE
  QNL - LINK      165 (jkl)  nearest LINK(IRLP, ILinke, Elink, etc)
  QNM - Mobile    166 (Mno)  nearest MOBILE
  QNR - Repeater  167 (pRs)  Nearest Voice Repeater
  QNV - tbd       168 (tuV)  tbd
  QNW - Weather   169 (Wxy)  nearest WEATHER to you
  QN*             16*        Marks the current TARGET as the new REFERENCE
  QN#             16#        Returns a HELP list of all NEAREST options

  Voice Response is:
    "NEAREST <STN/OBJ> TO <REFERENCE> IS <DIRECTION> <DISTANCE> MILES"

POSITION RELATIVE QUERIES:   These Queries return the position as a
  direction and distance of the Target station/object relative to
  various pre-defined Reference locations.  If no callsign or object
  is entered, then it is assumed to be the same Target station/object
  as the last one.

    QRY/MODIFIER     KEY        POSITION RELATIVE TO THESE REFERENCES
    ---------------  ---------  --------------------------------------------
    QRZ              171 (qZ )  QRZ, who is the current APRStt user?
    QRC - Club       172 (ABC)  the CLUB site
    QRD - Downtown   173 (DEF)  downtown
    QRG - GPS        174 (GHI)  GPS coordinates  TBD
    QRL - LAST Obj   175 (JKL)  Last marked object
    QRM - Me         176 (MNO)  ME
    QRR - Repeater   177 (PRS)  our repeater
    QRT - TTone      178 (TUV)  the APRStt location
    QRW - WXY???     179 (WXY)  our WX station
    QR* -            17*        Marks the REFERENCE as the new TARGET
    QR#              17#        Returns a HELP list of all RELATIVE options

    Voice Response is:
       "<TARGET> IS <DIRECTION> <DISTANCE> MILES FROM <REFERENCE>"


OTHER IDEAS:

    QA  - Age of last packet sent by station CCCC
    QEM - What is the Email address of CCCC
    QL  - who was the last user (previous)
    QOF - What is the Operating Frequency of CCCC
    QTH - What is current location of CCCC

ICONS:  APRStt uses the same ICONS subset as the Kenwoods.  These
are entered as a two digit hash from the first two letters of the
name of the ICON.  For example enter "CA" (22) for a car.  If no
ICON is entered, the default is for a "person".

22 CAr    72 SAilboat  77 RV         82 VAn


SPECIAL EMAIL FORMATS:
----------------------
I have proposed to enhance the existing APRS EMAIL system to allow for
a number of special shortcuts for common EMAIL needs.  Since most
mobile APRS Email messages are entered from a TTone keyboard, (even on
a Kenwood), it only makes sense to abbreviate many of the key strokes
commonly used.  Here is what I have proposed:

   :EMAIL    :email@address message...  - This is the original format
   :E        :Email@address message...  - Abbreviates EMAIL
   :CALL     :E message                 - Use Email address of station
                                          "CALL" if known.

To simplify the entry of Email Addresses in APRStt, the * key will be
interpreted as an @ symbol and the # will be interpreted as a DOT (.).
Notice that the CALL type email above in general APRS use, requires
APRStt and/or the WU2Z or other EMAIL engine to search for the CALL to
see if an Email address has been provided.


RETRIES:
--------

Once APRSt receives a DTMF message or position entry, it  temporarily
holds the APRS packet translation and responds to the user with its
interpretation of the packet.  Then the user must hit the OK button
"D" to actually have APRStt take responsibility for it and begin
sending it on the APRS channel.

At his point, APRStt assumes responsibility for all retries and
message acks.   It uses a similar decaying algorithm to that used
by APRSdos.  That is, any new packet is sent once, and a decay timer
set to 18 seconds later.  After each such delay, the packet is
transmitted again and the decay is doubled (actually, a factor of 1.8).
This results in 5 retries over the first 7 minutes:

 * 18s * 32s * 58s * 105s * 3m * 5.5m * 10m * 18m

If an ACK is received for a message, the message is canceled and a
voice response "QSL MESSAGE FROM WB4APR".  Once a message gets past 7
minutes, without success, it is not transmitted again unless the
recepient is later heard on the air.  Positions cancel after the
7 minute window.  Of course the 7 minute window is based on having
RETRIES set to 5.  Retry is a variable under SETUP.


APRStt PRESENCE ON 144.39 and 147.525 (or whatever freq you can find)
------------------------------------- -------------------------------

APRStt will identify itself on 144.39 like any other APRS station with
a Position, a Status, an Object and a Bulletin all transmitted via only
the LOCAL DIGI.  It will use the MYCALL of "APRSTT".  To avoid conflicts
and overlaps, adjacent machines will use different SSID's.

  ICON:  Box with "tt" in it or something looking like a TTone pad
  POSN:  The physical location of the machine.  Comment has FCC call
  OBJT:  A 30 mile AREA box bounding the MYCENTER location of coverage
  STTS:  "on 147.555 Try it!  TouchTone APRS!"
  BLN1:  "CALL=Acccc, Pos=Blat*lon Msg=Cto*msg. End = D."

The Bulletin is carefully crafted to fit the screen of a TH-D7.  The
object BOX is a 22 to 33 mile box centered on the MYCENTER LAT/LONG.
The reason for this is because all abbreviated position formats can only
be plus or minus 29 minutes of LAT/LONG from the center location without
ambiguity.  Thus, about 30 miles in Southern States and about 23 miles
in Seattle.

Similarly, APRStt will identify itself on 147.525 once every 10 minutes
with a BRIEF CW or Voice announcement:

  Voice:  "APRSTT <callsign>"


SPECIAL TRACKING:
-----------------

To help voice users keep track of special moving objects such as the
LEAD and TAIL at a marathon, APRStt can be told to TRACK special objects
and report by voice the position of these objects as they come in on
packet.  Remember 'SPCL' is a special APRS TOCALL that all APRS programs
are supposed to treat in a special fashion.  This same special
designation can be used to signal APRStt which stations/trackers are
special.

Since the Mic-E format uses the TOCALL for latitude and cannot use
SPCL, we can still signal the special tracking feature in APRStt by
selecting the TRIANGLE ICON.  I had Kenwood include the generic
TRIANGLE Icon in the D7 and D700 for just this kind of future potential.
On the D700 select OTHER and set to the symbol of "n" and table of "\".

When a position report comes in marked SPCL, (or with an icon of "\n"),
APRStt will say:

  <CALL> is <DIRECTION> <DISTANCE> miles from <REFERENCE>

Or you can follow the ACTIVATE TRACKER command with a callsign and
then APRStt will also track that callsign too.  Format is AT*ccccc.
Later if you want to clear that callsign, just do an AT*NONE.  Only
one call can be entered this way.  To track more than one, they must
set either the ICON or the SPCL...

APRStt TIPS FOR SPECIAL EVENTS:
-------------------------------

1) For "route" style events, simply prepare a list of objects represent-
ing known locations such as 000 to 027 being Mile Marks, 1xx being
special locations, 2xx being Food places, 3xx being Hotels, 4xx being
Hospitals.  For  small events, just transmit these locally as local
objects the days before, so that APRStt can capture them.  For larger
events, you may want to prepare the file offline...

2) Consider SHORT tacitcal calls for all users.  APRStt defaults to
requiring 4 letter legal calls (it wants to see the numeral as a check
on its validity).  Or select the NOCALLS option in APRStt to disable
this check so that any 4 letter sequence may be used.

3) Have everyone put their FULLY spelled out callsign in their DTMF
memory #1 including the terminating "D" key.  This should only need to
be used once at each venu, but will always be required for APRStt
anyway...

4) Then in the next location put their HASHED call ending with a "B" so
that it can be followed by either the 2x2D or 4x4D manual position report.

5) You can fill up remaining memories with either KNOWN positions or
with a list of PRE-Prepared message reports.


APRStt SOFTWARE CONCEPTS:
-------------------------

Here was my approach to implement this initial APRStt program.

1)  All packets heard on either the APRS channel or the APRStt audio
channel are saved (after removing dupes and keeping track of the time
of receipt).  My buffer is currently 500 deep and when full, overwrites
the oldest packet.  A longer buffer than about 24 hours worth of
callsigns is not desired as it just adds to the probability of duplicate
hashes.

1.5) Note-to-me: Here is how I capture packets:
     /@ taken as is in normal format
     != add TOR  to convert to normal
     ;  Objects  converted  to normal
     $GPRMS and GGA add TOR to normal (later)
     Mic-E REMAIN AS IS SO PARSE-PACKET has to CONVERT on the fly

2)  All DTMF-to-Packet packets are sent to the TOCALL of APTxxx where
xxx is the software version number.  This clearly identifies the packets
as having been generated by APRStt and not by some other XXXX-11
station.  This distinction is required so that users of DTMF are always
identifiable.

3)  A SEND buffer holds all the currently scheduled APRStt data
received from DTMF users and scheduled for transmission.  On receipt
of any new ICON, STATUS, or POSITION data from a DTMF user this buffer
is scanned and any previous position packet is updated and the
transmit decay timing is restarted.  Any ACKED messages are removed,
as well as any OLD packets.

4)  A separate LIST (or other mechanism) must always keep a copy of the
current data for all DTMF users even if it is old.  THis is used to
maintain the last konwn position and ICON and STATUS for each such user.

5)  APRStt packets all use the "/" position type indicator with time
stamp to show when it entered the system and that it is not message
capable.  APRStt packets conform to the following format:

   USER>APTxxx:/DDHHMMzDDMM.hhN/DDDMM.hhW]no_comment/status......

Notice that the comment field (no_comment) is exactly 10 characters long
in order to match the definitions of the 13 standard Mic-E comments and
also to match the 10 character wide screen of the D7.

6)  APRStt uses a decaying timing algorithm where new DTMF generated
packets are transmitted relatvely frequently when new, and then decay
to longer periods.  Any transmission beyond about 5 retrires (about
5 minutes) is usually not a good idea...

7)  There must be a callsign timeout. That is, a DTMF callsign is
valid for a limited time and or packets after initial receipt.  The
exact algorithm is TBD.

8)  DTMF tones can be as brief as only a few milliseconds, so APRStt
program execution must check the DTMF port every few milliseconds.

9)  Since different fields can be included in differing formats above,
Position, Icon, and status infromation from the DTMF user should be
overwritten individualy in modified packets and not necessarily used
to start a NEW packet on each new entry.  Thus, a new position uses
the same ICON and STATUS until they are changed, etc.

APRStt CONNECTIONS FOR THE DTMF chip to the LPT1 PORT        20 May 2002
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  WB4APR

THis was all I hooked up to give the demo's at dayton.  I need to modify
this to add the ability for the 8880 chip to SEND DTMF back to the end
user if he has one of the DTMF messaging radios.  For now, I am only
concentrating on the DTMF receive side.  But if anyone is considering
making this in to a small board, then remember that it will eventually
need to have DTMF send also.

This design below uses the 5 available Input pins on the Parallel port
and does NOT attempt to use the port as a bi-directional port which will
not work on all PC's...

In software, to get the 8880 chip 4 bit outputs to read properly,

1) First XOR with 128 to reverse the Hardware inversion
2) Then binary divide by 16 to right shift the data.
3) Note that D3 is the state of the KEY press.  It is 0 if no key
   and goes to 1 if there is a key pressed.  Get this bit with AND 8


XXX CIRCUIT:  This circuit unloads the digit-detect output and isolates
              it from the R/C time constant of the 390k and 0.1 uF cap.
              Then it is inverted an used to feed the Pin 15 to tell the
              APRStt that a new digit has been received.

APRStt VOICE D/A CONVERTER  USING THE LPT1 PORT
-----------------------------------------------

As of July 2002, I have added VOICE response to APRStt to facilitate the
feedback of data to the user as he makes his entries and also in response
to Queries.

Speech is limited to pre-recorded WAV files only and is limited to the
alphabet and special words only.  These are distributed in three files.
One for the alphabet, one for special words, and a third file for added
words as needed.  But ANYONE can re-record these files and use my
WAVETEST.EXE utility to rebuild their own index TABLE files to match
so that their APRSTT uses their voice!  Here are the words in each file.

ALPHABET.WAV = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 0123456789 IS
               Derived words A, I, OK, TO, ARE, BE, SEE, YOU, WHY

WORDS1.WAV   = at, is, on, from, no, match, error, your,
               north, south, east, west, nearest, gate, mobile, weather
               bad, posit, message, email, from, repeater
               point, my, miles, per, hour, minutes, packet, sent

WORDS3.WAV   = this_is, who_are_you, about, dash, target, reference,
               headed, milemark

        Note:  Multiple entries in the WORDS.TBL file can point
               to the same or overlaping sections in the WAV file
               for example "aprs" and "aprstt" in WORDS2

PTT BUFFER CIRCUIT
------------------

This circuit converts the TTL level LPT1 Strobe bit to an open collector
PTT output that should work with all radios...  The 220k and 100 uF
capacitor are a watchdog timer that will prevent the circuit from holding
down PTT for longer than 22 seconds and the 10uF caps are to filter any
noise from getting into the Mic circuit when PTT is combined with Mic
audio on HT's.   To combine PTT with Mic Audio, simply run the PTT output
to the mic input through a 2.2k resistor.
