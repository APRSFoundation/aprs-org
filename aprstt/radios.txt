TABLE of APRS-TouchTone RADIO Compatibility                 9 Oct 2008

There are 26 known methods or systems in Amateur Radio that can do
text messaging.  Many of them rely on the telephone key-pad for data
entry.  The APRS radios (D7, D700, D710, VX8R etc) all use the keypad
for text entry.  Since 2001 or so we have been trying to use DTMF text 
messaging from ANY HT with a DTMF key pad so that all ham radio 
operators can check-in to APRS, not just those with APRS radios.  The 
DTMF to APRS gateway is called APRStt Touchtone).  See

www.aprs.org/aprstt.html

This is all part of the Universal Ham Radio Text Messaging Initiative
see:  www.aprs.org/aprs-messaging.html

This file and table below will help us document all existing DTMF 
capabilities in ham radios.  Basically there are three classes:

* Radios with APRS packet directly (D7, D700, D710, VX8R and DR135)
* Radios with some kind of DTMF to text messaging (rudimentary)
* All other radios with DTMF keypads

Even if not used for APRS, using such digital signaling from the field
can be very valuable for events... www.aprs.org/aprsevent.html

Radio   mem #  Alpha  Encoding
------- --- -- -----  ------------------------------------------------

TH-D7   10  16 1=qz   multi-press A=next-letter. Full APRS packet
TM-D700 10  16 1=qz   multi-press A=next-letter. Full APRS packet
TM-D710 ??  16 1=qz   multi-press C=next-letter. Full APRS packet
VX-8R   ??  ?? 7=PQRS multi-press "mode"=next-letter. Full APRS packet

FT-51R  10  12 1=QZ   TX & RX two-key-using A/B/C    (sold 1995-1999)
        10  15 DTMF   for normal autodialing (or more messages)
FT-11R and FT-41R also have this capability

TH-78   10   6 1=QZ   TX & RX two-key-using A/B/C for 6 letter msgs
                      can combine for up to 60 letter message
        10  15 DTMF   for normal autodialing (or more messages!)

Cell Phones    7=pqrs multipress  PAUSE=next-letter
Echolink...    1=QZ   two-digits-per-letter-fixed

APRStt:        7=pqrs multi-press A=next-letter
               Callsigns use two-key method
