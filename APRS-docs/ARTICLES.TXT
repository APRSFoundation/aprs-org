ABSTRACT
ARTICLES.TXT      A brief history and bibliography of APRS.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Updated 12 Sept 2013, to add the original Teaneck New Jersey paper of
1992 which was mentioned in the text, but not listed in the bibleography
and to correct my email address.

This file consists of a brief history of the development of APRS and then
a bibleography of most of the articles that have been written about APRS.

THE HISTORY OF APRS

The Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) software has evolved over the
last 18 years of my involvement in amateur packet radio.  In 1976 I had
built the first digital RTTY on the air automatic message system which
evolved into a dual port phone and packet radio BBS for the AMRAD group
when ASCII first became legal in the late 70s [1].  In 1978 we began
experimenting with the original VADCG packet boards from Canada.  For years
I was on the AMRAD board of directors, the Amateur Radio  Reasearch and
Development group that was instrumental in the original specification for
AX.25 written by Terry Fox, WB4JFI and published by AMRAD in 1984.  Isolated
overseas in Japan in 1982, I wrote my first data maping program, which took
NAVY HF position reports off the air and displayed them on an APPLE-II.
From the beginning, I was always making packet maps of the growing packet
network [3,5,6].  In 1983, I wrote a gateway/BBS program on my VIC-20
computer to permit simultaneous operation of both HF and VHF ports for
exchange of packet messages and pioneered the use of 200 Hz shift for packet
on HF with cross-county links to W0RPK, W9TD, and K7PYK [2].  We used 10.149
MHz.  To my knowledge, this was the first amateur HF BBS/GATEWAY; and it
remained on the air 'round the clock for 5 years through 1989 under the FCC
STA for automatic packet HF operations.

     My APRS connectionless protocol idea was first used in a VIC-20 program
in 1984 for reporting the position and status of horses in a 100 mile cross
country endurence run for AMRAD [4].  I spent two years improving the idea
for amateur packet radio support of the National Disaster Medical System
exercises sponsored by FEMA [7,8,9].  During this time frame I called it
the Connectionless Emergency Traffic System (CETS).  At the end of the
second national exercise, I dropped the C-64 and began to port CETS to the
new IBM PC.  I also began to integrate packet mapping into the program.

During 1990 I got tired of trying to find a public domain set of maps
and began to digitize the East Coast myself with a TEXT format so that any
HAM could draw a map for any local packet application using only a text
editor.  Once that maping decision was made, APRS evolved nightly as I
began to play with it on the air, and realized its potential.  I also realized
that I could use my callsign in the name and changed the name to Automatic
Packet Reporting System.  I published the APRS paper at the ARRL 11th
Computer Networking Conference in 1992.  From then on, for a decade, APRS has 
consumed thousands of hours of evenings and weekends as I tweaked the 
program and drew maps.

In 1994 I introduced the Mic-E pic processor for putting APRS into the 
microphone on any radio.  Kenwood eventually implemented this in their
TH-D7 in 1998.  Then they released the D700 around the year 2000.  In
the 1996 time frame PacComm implemented my new digipeating ideas in their
TNC's so that Digipeaters would do callsign Substitution.  Then in 1998
Kantronics finally implemented my 1994 idea of the WIDEn-N digipeating
system.

Finally, I am not doing this to make money on amateur radio.  The
registration contribution helps defray the mailing hassles and the
psychological burden of having hundreds of HAMS all across the country call
me at home at all times of the evening with repititious and continuous
questions.  I learned this lesson the hard way by releasing my C-64 BBS
source code to the HAM community in 1984 for free.  In 1995, 11 years 
later, I was still getting phone calls, letters without SASE's, and 
registered letters from third world countries (requiring a trip to the 
post office) asking questions about this obsolete software!
